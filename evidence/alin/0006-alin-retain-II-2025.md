## Argument

Over the past few months, I’ve been fully focused on designing and implementing the new collator protocol—the interface that enables communication between backing validators and collators.

This is a critical protocol upgrade aimed at improving the reliability and resilience of the parachain backing process. It ensures that parachain liveness is maintained at all times, a key requirement as we prepare for the migration to Asset Hub.

With major foundational pieces already merged—such as [the UMP primitives](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7955) and the [reputation-based peer manager](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8191)—I’ve shifted my focus to implementing the final core components needed to kick off the testing phase.

The ongoing work is centered on [this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8541), which introduces the CollationManager and implements the main subsystem logic. The finish line is in sight, and the implementation will ship with comprehensive unit tests to ensure robustness.
