## Argument

My work during the reporting period was sufficient to justify my retention at Rank III for the following reasons:

## Asset Hub Migration

I work on a project that is relevant for Polkadot's long term goals; the Asset Hub Migration. We recently deployed the Migration on Westend to test its code and dry-run the procedures needed to later on deploy it on Kusama and subsequently Polkadot.

The migration was mostly successful although we stalled the Asset Hub for a few hours which lead to dropped DMP messages. This necessitated some manual cleanup in the end to ensure that all storage items were migrated. Several issues were identified that will be addressed before we go ahead with Kusama.

My role in this project is to oversee the code changes for the migration. This includes reviewing and guiding newer developers to help them participate. I regard this to be of adequate scope for a Rank III Fellow.

## Knowledge Sharing

I created the `https://docs.jamcha.in` website to facilitate knowledge sharing between aspiring JAM implementors on topics that are not specified in the Gray Paper.  
This is being adopted by other teams as evident by the number of [external merge requests](https://github.com/JamBrains/jam-docs/commits/main/).

## JAM Client

I deepened my knowledge on the next iteration of Polkadot by implementing a JAM client with a few colleagues. This demonstrates my ability and will to pivot to new topics that will be relevant in the future. I think this is an important skill to keep outpacing other ecosystems on the technical frontier.

Although in this case, the JAM Prize also plays a substantial role :)

## Voting record

My global voting participation remains at 89.53% as per my own [dashboard](https://fellowship.tasty.limo/). My last evidence mentions 93.68% overall activity, hence I will enter the lower number here.
