## **Evidence**

My expertise in the Polkadot ecosystem lies primarily in Snowbridge, the community-owned Ethereum ⇄ Polkadot bridge that is part of the Polkadot SDK.

Over the past three months, I have concentrated on the following four major areas:

1. **Snowbridge V2:** Reducing bridge fees, improving user experience, and introducing new features such as arbitrary contract execution.
2. **Decentralizing Snowbridge Relayers:** Preparing to support parties outside of the Snowbridge team to run relayers.
3. **Enhancing Snowbridge Community Communication:** Keeping the community informed and involved in Snowbridge developments.
4. **Revamping the Snowbridge UI:** Making the Snowbridge UI more engaging, and user-friendly.

### Snowbridge V2

The majority of my efforts this quarter have been dedicated to Snowbridge V2. I have been responsible for implementing two critical components of the design:

- **Inbound Queue v2:** Implemented the new message format and mapping from an Ethereum command to XCM v5. ([polkadot-sdk#6578](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6578))
- **Unified Rewards:** Adding to the bridge-relayers pallet to support tracking relayer rewards and payout to any account on AssetHub. [polkadot-sdk#6697](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6697)

### Decentralize Snowbridge relayers

Another focus has been preparing Snowbridge relayers to operate independently of the core team. This involved creating infrastructure scripts and comprehensive documentation to simplify the setup process for external operators.

- [Relayer setup docs](https://docs.snowbridge.network/operations/run-relayers)

### Improve Snowbridge Community Communication

Improving communication within the Snowbridge community has been another priority. This included creating content for social media, contributing to discussions on the Polkadot forum, and addressing community inquiries.

Polkadot Forum Posts:

- [Snowbridge on Kusama](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/snowbridge-on-kusama/11079)
- [Snowbridge September Update](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/snowbridge-september-update/10389/1)

Social Media Contributions:

- All posts from the [Snowbridge account](https://x.com/_snowbridge) since September 2024.

### Other Work

Some smaller work items I have completed during the quarter:

- **Polkadot upgrade to `stable-2409`**: Updating the Polkadot runtime to support the release of Snowbridge Polkadot native assets on Ethereum and free Ethereum consensus updates, as part of the upgrade to Polkadot `stable-2409`. ([pandres95#2](https://github.com/pandres95/runtimes/pull/2), [pandres95#3](https://github.com/pandres95/runtimes/pull/3), [pandres95#4](https://github.com/pandres95/runtimes/pull/4))
- **Improved testing of Snowbridge:** Set up daily end-to-end smoketests against the latest stable branch of the polkadot-sdk, to ensure no regressions are introduced ([Github Actions runner](https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge/actions/runs/12388724871), [snowbridge#1287](https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge/pull/1287)).

### Snowbridge UI

I have worked on improving the Snowbridge UI to enhance its visual appeal and user experience. The updated design is set to launch in January 2025 and is intended to bring more personality and professionalism to the platform.
