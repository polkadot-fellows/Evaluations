## Evidence

### Strengthening XCM Security & Execution

- **[#7200 - XCM: Deny barrier checks for nested XCMs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7200)**
  - **Security Enhancement:** Strengthened XCM validation by preventing unauthorised nested XCM executions, reducing potential attack vectors. Closes [#7148 - Investigate better support for filtering XCM programs with Barrier](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7148).
- **[#7351 - PoC(XCM): Deny Nested XCM Barriers](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7351)**
  - **Proof of Concept:** Explored stricter XCM validation mechanisms to prevent bypassing of security barriers, improving overall protocol robustness.

#### Developer Experience & Usability

- **[#883 - Fix Basic Usage code in Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/pull/883)**
  - **Documentation Fix:** Resolved incorrect example in Chopsticks to enhance usability and correctness for developers.

#### Improving Observability & Debugging

- **[#7234 - Add EventEmitter to XCM executor](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7234)**
  - **Enhanced Traceability:** Verified and refined event emission logic in XCM execution, enabling better tracking of cross-chain message flows. Closes [#6851 - Implement error-specific events](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6851).
- **[#7003 - Enhance logging for XCM filters, helpers, and matchers](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7003)**
  - **Debugging Enhancement:** Improved logging visibility for XCM components, making debugging more efficient for developers.
- **[#7594 - Enhance XCM Debugging with Log Capture in Unit Tests](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7594)**
  - **Test Debugging Improvement:** Introduced a lightweight log-capturing mechanism for XCM unit tests, simplifying debugging through structured log assertions. Closes [#6125 - Enable unit test logging](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6125).
- **[#7769 - Ensure Logs Are Captured for Assertions and Printed During Tests](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7769)**
  - **Enhanced Test Logging:** Ensures logs up to TRACE level are captured (for assertions) and printed (for visibility) during test execution, improving developer tracing and debugging.
- **[#7734 - Simplify event assertion with predicate-based check](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7734)**
  - **Improved Test Flexibility:** Introduced `contains_event` to simplify event assertions, reducing redundancy and improving test flexibility.

### Ongoing Work & Future Contributions

- **[#6119 - XCM Observability & Debuggability](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6119)**
  - **Goal:** Enhancing XCM traceability through structured event emissions, improved logging, and debugging toolsâ€”empowering developers to diagnose cross-chain issues faster.
