## Argument

I am applying for Rank I retention.

My contributions have focused on developing Hyperbridge which is one of two Trustless Bridges serving the Polkadot Ecosystem.

### **My contributions to Polkadot through Hyperbridge**

* Hyperbridge provides the only multichain trustless interoperability protocol for the Polkadot Ecosystem. At launch of the Polkadot Hub Hyperbridge will be immediately available and it will provide the following to applications:

    * Access to liquidity and users from the EVM ecosystem like Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Bsc, Polygon, Gnosis and among others.
    * Ability to send and receive arbitary messages and data from EVM networks.

* Hyperbridge maintains a native bridge for the DOT token to the liquidity hubs of the EVM ecosystem, including Ethereum, Bsc, Base and Arbitrum with highly active liquidity pools.  This is important to the Polkadot ecosystem for the upcoming Polkadot hub launch as Hyperbridge provides a decentralized access to the DOT token for new users and developers   that need to perform actions on the hub.

* My team and I are currently working on a more native Hyperbridge integration for Polkadot Hub that will increase the efficiency and reduce latency of consensus updates to the Polkadot Hub  
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10140 - A PR from the Hyperbridge Team which adds an Inherent that would handle Hyperbridge Consensus Updates to the Polkadot Hub


### **Direct Contributions to Polkadot-sdk**

* I have a PR under review for a spec compliant EIP-7702  implementation for pallet-revive. This will enable Polkadot Hub support account abstraction for EOAs - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10851
