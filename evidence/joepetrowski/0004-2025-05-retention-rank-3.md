## Reporting period

- End date: 2024/05/31

## Argument

During this reporting period I have worked primarily on the on-chain protocol aspects of "Plaza" --
namely the Asset Hub Migration and introduction of smart contracts via the Revive pallet.

Both of these projects are on track with the timelines that we initially communicated late last
year. The completion of these projects should reduce the barrier to entry for on-chain and off-chain
developers and allow them to build better products and UX on the Polkadot stack.

The Revive pallet was introduced on Westend and several hackathons have used this platform in the
last six months. We have taken feedback from them to improve docs and integration compatibility.

The Asset Hub Migration ran its first large scale test in May by performing a test migration on
Westend. Although there were a few issues, we have the tools to be able to identify them in a test
environment prior to running the Kusama and Polkadot migrations.

I have been active in communicating the significance of these upgrades to Polkadot with regular
participation in OpenDev calls and meetings with stakeholders (e.g. wallets, exchanges) to make the
upgrades successful.
