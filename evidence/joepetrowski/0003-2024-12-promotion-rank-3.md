## Evidence

During this evaluation period, I have primarily focused on defining the scope of changes to make on
the Polkadot "Hub" in the next year (a.k.a. the "Plaza program"). Many of these plans were outlined
in [this blog post](https://www.parity.io/blog/polkadot-smartcontract-platform). As the title
suggests, most changes are proposed with the intention of making Polkadot more accessible, whether
it is to on-chain developers and tinkerers via smart contracts, to systems integrators via migrating
Relay functionality to Asset Hub, to application developers via more stable, network-based rather
than chain-based APIs, and to businesses via aggregated metrics and monitoring tools.

I have also participated in local meetups and events in Zug (e.g. Crypto Valley Summit, Polimec
meetups) to talk about Polkadot and the roadmap.
