## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [ ] Concern(s): 

- [X] Comment(s):
  - Besides code contributions, I have been following new releases and reviewing them when I find something noteworthy. I am also an active participant in the monthly fellowship calls.
  - Even though I inducted myself in the salary pallet, I ended up not claiming the salary due to being less active than I wanted to be.
