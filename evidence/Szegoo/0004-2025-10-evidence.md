## Evidence

Over the past period, my primary focus has been on working with Coretime.

I have mainly been involved with what is currently the primary interface for managing Coretime and tracking Coretime-related data: [RegionX Hub](https://hub.regionx.tech/).

I’ve talked with many users, teams, and projects from across the ecosystem, designing a project that makes utilizing the Agile Coretime model more intuitive for teams building on Polkadot.

I have also attended this year’s Web3 Summit and Dark Prague.
