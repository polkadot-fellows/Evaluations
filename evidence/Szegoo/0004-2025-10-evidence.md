## Evidence

Over the past period, my primary focus has been on working with Coretime.

I have mainly been involved with what is currently the primary interface for managing Coretime and tracking Coretime-related data: [RegionX Hub](https://hub.regionx.tech/).

I’ve talked with many users, teams, and projects from across the ecosystem, designing a project that makes utilizing the Agile Coretime model more intuitive for teams building on Polkadot.

Since the last reporting period, I have also completed the following PR:
- [Implementation of on-demand credits as described in RFC-1](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5990)

I have also pushed forward a change to enable cross-chain region transfers, thanks to which there is now a secondary Coretime marketplace live on Kusama, with me being the lead implementer of it. The related PR on the Coretime chain side: https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/483

I have also attended this year’s Web3 Summit and Dark Prague.
