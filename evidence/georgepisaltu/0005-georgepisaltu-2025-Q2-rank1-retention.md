## Argument

This reporting period I have been, yet again, fully focused on leading the Proof of Personhood
effort. As the release date, announced publicly to be Q4 2025, is getting closer, we wrapped up
development on DIM1, DIM2 and adjacent features, with the People registry having been published
earlier this year.

I cannot go into the details of the DIMs or the features we bundled for recognized people as the
plan at this moment is to make them public as close to the actual release as possible. I am,
however, excited to announce that not only the DIMs but all the adjacent features, including the
(financial) reward schemes we have planned for people, have passed audit scrutiny. The features are
currently being successfully deployed on private testnets where they undergo testing and we are in
the process of preparing the release.

On top of this, I am heavily involved in the design and implementation of the native decentralized
stablecoin announced at the Web3 Summit earlier this month. The mechanism behind it will make use of
the proof of personhood functionality delivered in the overall package the team has been working on.
