## Evidence

My contributions this period have been grounded in the Polkadot Fellowship’s mission to uphold a decentralized, secure, and adaptable ecosystem. By focusing on assets, governance, collectives, XCM, and bridges, my efforts support the network’s core values of resilience and scalability.

### Assets

Asset management is a foundational aspect of my work in Polkadot, as it underpins the network’s ability to support a range of decentralized applications, payment solutions, NFTs, and cross-chain interactions.

Increasing the capabilities of asset handling is essential for scalability and user experience, especially as the ecosystem grows with projects requiring sophisticated asset solutions. My contributions, such as the `pallet-assets-holder` and patches for asset management modules, aim to improve the flexible, resilient framework that supports seamless functionality across parachains, benefiting both developers and users by enhancing existing use cases and security in asset handling.

#### Contributions to Assets

1. **Implementation of `pallet-assets-holder`**

   I authored the [`pallet-assets-holder`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4530), a significant addition to the Polkadot SDK designed to enhance asset management capabilities. Since my last report, I've continued to improve it, considering the extensive and thorough review process that authoring this pallet has involved. These enhancements will enable new use cases for asset management processes, improving user experience. The implementation involved navigating complex SDK dependencies and multiple cross-functional reviews to ensure seamless integration, highlighting my commitment to quality and collaborative problem-solving.

2. **Patch for `Freezer` and `dead_account` Issues**

   During the review process of the `pallet-assets-holder`, we identified a critical design flaw in the integration between `Freezer` and `dead_account` logic. To address this, I authored a [patch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5948) that rectified these issues, thereby improving the resilience and predictability of asset management within the SDK.

   This patch helps ensure consistent and secure handling of freezing asset sets across different parachains, enhancing user confidence in the protocol. Resolving this issue required a deep dive into asset logic and collaboration with reviewers to validate the patch’s effectiveness.

### Governance

I am deeply committed to the continuous improvement of Polkadot's native governance toolkit. A robust governance framework is essential for maintaining the network's decentralization, security, and adaptability. By refining governance tools, we can ensure that decision-making processes are transparent, inclusive, and efficient, fostering greater community engagement and trust. This focus on governance enhancements directly supports Polkadot’s mission to provide a resilient and user-governed ecosystem.

#### Contributions to Governance

1. **RFC for Iterable Referenda Tracks**

   To advance the governance toolkit, I co-authored an [RFC for Iterable Referenda Tracks](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/121). This proposal aims to optimize the efficiency and accessibility of referenda, promoting a more inclusive and transparent governance framework. By introducing iterable tracks, we can streamline the management of referenda, making it easier for community members to participate in governance processes, thus fostering a more active and engaged community.

   I am currently working on an implementation of the iterable tracks for PSDK runtimes, using `pallet-parameters` (currently in progress, not yet published, still worth mentioning). By streamlining referenda management, the iterable tracks implementation is expected to enhance community engagement and lower entry barriers, making participation in governance more accessible and appealing to a broader audience. The expected completion for this feature is Q1 2025 (hopefully), with ongoing efforts focused on integration with `pallet-parameters`.

### Unbrick Collective

The Unbrick Collective will be essential for maintaining the operational resilience of parachains on Polkadot, enabling targeted intervention when parachains face block production issues due to runtime failures. My interest in this collective lies in its strategic role within Polkadot’s governance, ensuring continuity even in rare failure cases by providing a reliable mechanism for addressing these critical issues, thus bolstering confidence among developers and stakeholders.

#### Contributions to Unbrick Collective

1. **RFC for Unbrick Collective**

   I co-authored an [RFC](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/117) proposing the establishment of the Unbrick Collective within the Polkadot ecosystem. This collective is designed to assist parachain teams in recovering from situations where their parachains have ceased producing blocks, commonly referred to as "bricking." The Unbrick Collective aims to provide a structured and efficient mechanism for unbricking parachains, thereby enhancing the resilience and reliability of the Polkadot network. Crafting this proposal involved anticipating governance complexities and ensuring a protocol-aligned framework, requiring extensive discussion with stakeholders.

   Based on stakeholder feedback, I'm working on specific adjustments to address concerns around emergency intervention mechanisms, showcasing a collaborative and responsive approach.

2. **Implementation Support**

   I authored a draft [Pull Request #5429](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5429), which aims to implement the Unbrick Collective at the PSDK level, further enhancing the operability of collectives within the network. The draft requires careful consideration of knowledge on the parachains model part of the protocol, as well as the origins mechanisms, to balance emergency response with network stability, demonstrating a structured approach to problem-solving and a commitment to keep learning about the protocol.

### XCM, Bridges, and Beyond

My focus on XCM, Bridges, and Polkadot’s core infrastructure is driven by an interest in continually learning about new areas of the protocol. XCM enables use cases that are essential to Polkadot’s success, while Bridges connect Polkadot to external ecosystems, fostering an interconnected blockchain network. By helping to streamline these contributions, Polkadot’s vision for a fully interoperable, multi-chain ecosystem with seamless and secure cross-chain communication is closer to realization.

Through efforts like runtime updates to the latest SDK, I aim to support these new additions in reaching mainnet.

#### Contributions

1. **Runtime Update to Latest Stable SDK**

   I facilitated runtime updates to the latest stable SDK version, as documented in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/490). This update marks an important milestone for me as a Rank 1, reinforcing my capability to handle critical protocol updates that enhance the stability and performance of the network.

### Conclusion

Each of these initiatives aligns with the Fellowship’s goals of ensuring Polkadot remains a robust and scalable ecosystem, with contributions that strengthen its technical and governance foundations. I am committed to these principles and look forward to continuing to support the Fellowship’s mission in future quarters.

This period has highlighted the importance of collaborative problem-solving and proactive governance development. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my involvement in cross-chain interoperability and further refine governance mechanisms, continuing to enhance Polkadot’s usability and resilience.
