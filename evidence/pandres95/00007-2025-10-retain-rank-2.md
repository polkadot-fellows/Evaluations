## Argument

Consistent with the evaluative standards defined for Rank I in the [Fellowship Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf), this Argument synthesizes my technical contributions over the reporting period, structured around core areas of protocol-level expertise and ecosystem-level stewardship.

This quarter, I finished the development of [`pallet-assets-vesting`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404), and handled an initial review for it. The pallet has already passed one review, and it's awaiting for a secondary review. Reasons for not having a secondary review so far are related to the Asset Hub Migration (AHM), thus higher ranking fellows, or qualified reviewers have been busy.

Also, I started and successfully finished a refactoring to remove the former [`Currency`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/currency/index.html) trait to the [Fungible](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html) traits family, in line with the [Token Horizon](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/327) vision. The pallet has already received an initial review, with small changes that need addressing. Also, this refactoring has let me learn to use stepped migrations, which is a quite useful skill to be a useful help in maintaining the network in the future.

## Write-ups

Continuing with the already mentioned [Token Horizon](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/327) vision, I saw it is possible to go a step further, and use the already existing [Consideration](https://docs.rs/frame-support/latest/frame_support/traits/trait.Consideration.html) trait to evolve the way storage holds are managed, in such a way that a mechanism for multi-currency (a.k.a. asset-based) storage deposits is possible. This [article](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/asset-based-storage-deposit-payments-for-polkadot-kusama/14757) published in the Polkadot Forum explains the basic mechanism, and the necessary steps to achieve it (including continuing the [migration of pallets](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/226) to `fungible`). This is the base for a future RFC that should be published by next quarter for public discussion.
