## Evidence

This quarter, I focused on advancing projects in **assets, governance, and runtime upgrades**, solidifying my technical contributions across Polkadot's evolving ecosystem.

### **Assets**

#### **Progression of `pallet-assets-vesting`**

- Advanced **`pallet-assets-vesting`** ([PSDK #7404](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404)) to the **in-review** stage.
- Addressed reviewer feedback to move toward a **mergeable and production-ready** version.
- This pallet enables **fungibles-compatible, time-based linear vesting**, expanding financial tools for Asset Hub and parachains.

### **Governance**

#### **Fix to Iterable Tracks Const Representation**

- Authored a fix to Iterable Tracks ([PSDK #7671](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7671)), resolving a bug affecting **constant representations**.
- This fix ensures **proper functionality** of the `const` query expected by client apps (e.g., **Polkadot.js Apps**, **Nova Wallet**), maintaining **seamless integration** for end users and tools.

### **Runtime Upgrades & Maintenance**

#### **Participation in Stable Upgrades and Release Coordination**

- Authored the upgrade to **`stable2412-4`** ([Runtimes #606](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/606)) for Polkadot Fellowship.
- Actively coordinated with the proposer of **Release 1.5.0** to align on timelines and approvals, culminating in a **successful merge**.
- This upgrade supports **protocol stability** for the 1.5.0 release cycle.

## **Conclusion**

Throughout this quarter, I reinforced my contributions to asset infrastructure, governance tooling reliability, and runtime upgrade processes. Completing fixes and progressing new pallets demonstrate my continued commitment to strengthening Polkadot's foundation.

This quarter also marks the completion of my **first year of contributions as a Fellowship member**. Over this period, I have experienced significant growth and learning, finding my niche within the ecosystem while expanding my interests across governance, assets, runtime maintenance, and interoperability. This journey has enriched my ability to contribute meaningfully to Polkadot's evolving needs.

Looking ahead, I will continue refining governance tooling, supporting collective initiatives, and expanding my contributions to XCM and bridges. I also plan to get involved in deeper aspects of the protocol, such as improvements to consensus protocols and enhancements to developer experience (DevX) in FRAME, ensuring robust, user-centered advancements across the ecosystem.
