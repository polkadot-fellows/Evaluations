## Argument for Retention

Consistent with the evaluative standards defined for Rank I in the [Fellowship Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf), this Argument synthesizes my technical contributions over the reporting period, structured around core areas of protocol-level expertise and ecosystem-level stewardship.

This quarter, I continued development of [`pallet-assets-vesting`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404), a fungibles-compatible module for linear, time-based asset vesting. I progressed the implementation to the in-review phase and began addressing feedback to make it production-ready for system chains.

I also resolved a critical issue in the Iterable Tracks governance feature ([PSDK #7671](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7671)), which affected how constant values were exposed to client applications like Polkadot.js and Nova Wallet. This fix restored expected behavior across tooling layers and ensured governance elements rendered correctly.

Finally, I authored and coordinated the inclusion of [`stable2412-4`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/606), a runtime upgrade aligned with the 1.5.0 Release. This required coordination with the proposer and ensured timely integration through Fellowship governance.

## Reflection and Forward Trajectory

This submission concludes my first year within the Fellowship. Over the course of the past twelve months, I have methodically deepened my involvement across the runtime, governance, and protocol lifecycle domains. My work has advanced from feature authoring to systematic maintenance, and from localized improvements to ecosystem-aware coordination.

This maturation has sharpened my alignment with the Fellowship's mission to uphold and advance protocol expertise critical to Polkadot’s technical continuity. In future quarters, I intend to expand into lower layers of the protocol, particularly consensus protocol development and FRAME-level ergonomics, while continuing to support cross-domain primitives such as XCM and system collectives.
