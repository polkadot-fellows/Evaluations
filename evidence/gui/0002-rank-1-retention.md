## Argument
I focused mainly on proof of personhood with George and Michal. Part of this work is now [public](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8164). My contributions include adding features and performing reviews in the people pallet, as well as implementing the origin restriction pallet.

Apart from PoP, I reviewed several PRs in polkadot-sdk, submitted some minor PRs, and reviewed the upgrade of runtimes to version 2412.

I continued working on the transaction extension horizon. A PR is currently open, aimed at simplifying the migration of unsigned transactions to general transactions, which is undergoing an audit. Another PR facilitates migrating existing unsigned transactions in polkadot-sdk to general transactions in a backward-compatible manner.
