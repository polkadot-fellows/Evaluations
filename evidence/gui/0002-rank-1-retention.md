## Argument
I focused mainly on proof of personhood, with George and Michal. Part of this work is now [public](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8164), my work include some feature and review in the people pallet and the implementation of origin restriction pallet.
Apart from PoP, I reviewed some PR in polkadot-sdk, and made some minor PR too, also reviewed the upgrade of runtimes to version 2412.
I continued the transaction extension horizon, a PR is open to easily migrate unsigned transaction to general transaction, currently in audit, and another PR to migrate in backward-compatible way the current unsigned transaction in polkadot-sdk to general transaction.
