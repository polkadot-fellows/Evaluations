## Argument
This period my main focus was on the proof of personhood project in the still private repository.
In order to deliver proof of personhood, I also added the statement-store to the omni-node ([here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8076)). This expands the feature-set of the omni-node and can benefit other projects.

I also continued the transaction extension horizon, the implementation of the logic to easily replace validate unsigned usage by general transaction usage is [merged](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6324).

And I did some review of PRs for polkadot:
I reviewed the optimistic project funding [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6994), and started implementing a feature-complete implementation of it given the original PR needs IMO more work and the developer has less time (this implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8753)).
I reviewed some other work such as the assets vesting pallet [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404) that improves the feature-set of assets in FRAME, and pallet multi assets bounties [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8381), a requested change for the current bounties on polkadot.
