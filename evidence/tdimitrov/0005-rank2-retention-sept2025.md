## Argument

During the reporting period my focus was the collator protocol stop-gap solution for the AssetHub
migration on Kusama (and Polkadot). Since we had not enough time to deliver the full protocol revamp
we agreed on a simpler and faster solution which despite not perfect will improve the resilience.
The [polkadot-sdk pr-9458](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9458) is complete but
still pending code reviews. In the description there are more details about the solution.

Currently I am working on a test tool which will simulate different scenarios so that we can test
the stop gap solution even further.

I was also assisting with the
[Kusama relay chain stall on August 24th](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2025-08-24-kusama-stall-postmortem/14729).

Another task I did was a small cleanup of the controlled validator indices change (please check my
previous retention document for details) -
[polkadot-sdk pr-8896](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8896).
