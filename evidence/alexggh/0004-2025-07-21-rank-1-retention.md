## Argument

During the reporting period, I continued my work on improving the scalability, stability, and performance of the Polkadot network.

On the performance side, I've spent most of my time helping to increase the parachains' single-core throughput by optimizing various parts of our Trie database and weights stack and evaluating the impact of the optimizations. For this goal, I [profiled](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6131#issuecomment-2891523233) and implemented  [several optimizations](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8606) to help pack more Solidity smart contract calls on AssetHub, this resulted in reducing the per key read/write costs in validation context from 25us/100us to around [13/31us](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8359). I also finished improving the parachain block import and authoring time by making sure we keep the entire state in memory inside the TrieCache [PR7682](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7682) and collaborated with Andrei Eres at an E2E test that prove the benefits of this optimisation with [ERC20 transfers](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7540#issuecomment-3009015002).

On the scalability and stability side, I worked on making sure [Polkadot](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2025-05-03-polkadot-parachain-block-time-degradation/12963) and [Kusama](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2025-05-09-kusama-dispute-storm-postmortem/12947/4) incidents are properly understood, and the lessons learnt from it addressed, to achieve this goal I've been involved in root-causing, providing fixes and versi scale testing of the changes. List of issues that I've been positively contributing to: [statement-distribution: skip leafs where we can't fetch the state](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8510), [dispute-coordinator: increase lru_observed_blocks_capacity](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8831), [increase session index cache](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8832), [extend overseer to send priority messages ](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8834), [dispute-coordinator: find_controlled_validator_indices takes a lot of time](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8823), [dispute-coordinator: handle race with offchain disabling](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9050).


### Other work:

Besides the mentioned topics, I'm providing reviews for my area of expertise in polkadot-sdk and RFCs.
