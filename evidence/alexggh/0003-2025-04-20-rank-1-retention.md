## Argument

During the reporting period, I continued my work on improving the scalability, stability, and performance of the Polkadot network.

On the performance side, I've spent most of my time helping to increase the parachains' single-core throughput by optimizing various parts of our Trie database and weights stack and evaluating the impact of the optimizations. For this goal, I worked on several topics:
- To help pack more Solidity smart contract calls on AssetHub, I'm working on reducing the configured [per read/write costs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6131) from the current worst-case scenario to a more [accurate benchmark](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7867) that reflects the average values we get in the validation context. To benefit from this lower weight, I'm also working to speed up parachain block import and authoring by making sure we keep the entire state in memory inside the TrieCache ([PR216](https://github.com/paritytech/trie/pull/216), [PR7682](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7682)).
- Maximize throughput for existing parachains by helping them use [more PoV](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8040) and providing them with a list of bespoke [optimizations/fixes](https://github.com/paritytech/project-mythical/pull/290) that significantly increased their existing throughput in the load tests.

On the scalability and stability side, I progressed on the goal of expanding the number of validators and cores to 1,000 validators and 200 cores ([Issue 5867](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5867)) by enabling and monitoring approval-voting-parallel on Polkadot ([7504](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7504)), increasing the number of validators on Kusama from [600 to 700](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/511) and on Polkadot from [500 to 600](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1484).


### Other work:

Besides the mentioned topics, I'm providing reviews for my area of expertise in polkadot-sdk and RFCs.
