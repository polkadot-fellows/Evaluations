# Fellowship Retention H1 2024

The following is a summary of what I have individually do. Most of this overlaps between what Parity expects of me, and what I should do as a part of Polkadot fellowship. 

The only area where this does not apply, is responsibilities that are solely related to management within Parity, as I am leading the FRAME team within Parity. All of the members of this team are also part of the fellowship: Ankan, Goncalo Liam, Nikhil and Oliver. 

For the time being, I do not plan to claim my fellowship salary, given that most of my work for Polkadot is paid for by Parity. Should this change, I do see the possibility to claim my salary on an irregular basis, if this changes.
