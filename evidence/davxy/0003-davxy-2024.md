## Evidence

### JAM

During this period, my primary focus has been on the development of Parity's
JAM prototype (*PolkaJam*). This effort included refining auxiliary crypto
specifications and generating test vectors critical for achieving
interoperability across all [JAM teams](https://graypaper.com/clients/).

I proposed additional test vectors to advance JAM implementations'
interoperability, specifically targeting the requirements of milestone 1 (M1).

[Tracking Issue](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/issues/21)

#### New Test Vector Proposals

- [Binary codec update](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/19)  
- [Recent blocks history STF](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/11)  
- [Work reports STF](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/20)  

### Support and Collaboration

I made occasional minor [contributions](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavxy)
to the JAM Graypaper during this period, primarily small fixes that may not be particularly noteworthy to report
explicitly here.

Provided sporadic support to JAM implementers in the JAM public channel,
primarily addressing topics within my areas of expertise.
