## Argument

Since joining the Polkadot Fellowship, I've had the opportunity to work on various technical challenges across the ecosystem. My journey has taken me from contributing to the Polkadot SDK as part of the SDK Node team to becoming involved with JAM development. Along the way, I've been able to contribute to various foundational specifications and implementations that support the broad Polkadot ecosystem.

Key contributions summary:
- Contributed to Sassafras and Safrole consensus protocol design and development
- Co-authored VRF-AD cryptographic scheme specification referenced in the JAM Gray Paper
- Developed the Bandersnatch VRF implementation currently used across all JAM teams
- Created comprehensive test vectors for JAM's state transition function
- Built fuzzing tools for JAM Milestone-1 conformance testing
- Established collaboration channels for cross-team coordination
- Core member of Parity's PolkaJAM team

### Sassafras

My initial work focused on analyzing and implementing the Sassafras consensus protocol from [Burdges et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/031) whitepaper. This first required developing a good understanding of the existing Substrate consensus implementations to properly integrate the new protocol.

The most significant technical challenge was mastering Ring-VRF design, which became a key area of expertise by itself. I collaborated closely with the W3F research team, occasionally contributing to their backends while integrating their research into a practical implementation.

Key deliverable from this work: A Sassafras working prototype implementation proposed in [PR #1336](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1336)

While this work was almost ready for upstream integration, development was paused when priorities shifted to Safrole for the JAM protocol.

### Safrole

The foundation built during Sassafras prototyping proved invaluable for the subsequent Safrole work - adaptation of Sassafras for the new JAM technology. The transition felt natural given that Safrole is fundamentally a derivative work simplified for JAM's unique requirements.

My contributions to Safrole include:
- I actively contributed to and reviewed the protocol design.
- Led the implementation of the protocol within the PolkaJAM codebase, including: core consensus logic, state transition, integration with authoring engine, Ring-VRF ticket generation, distribution and verification.

### Polkadot-SDK

My involvement with Polkadot-SDK ecosystem spans nearly four years as a Parity employee and as part of the Fellowship, during which I've developed expertise in the [Polkadot-SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) project. Before focusing on JAM development, I was primarily engaged with what were originally the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) libraries, with focus on foundational primitives as part of my daily job in the Parity's *Node SDK* team.

The years invested collaborating with first-class ecosystem engineers and researchers provided the invaluable foundation that shaped my technical perspective and capabilities.

### PolkaJAM

As a *PolkaJAM* team member, I try to being keep my knowledge up to date with the various subsystems, though my primary expertise lies in:

- **Safrole Consensus Engine**: Led implementation of consensus protocol, state transitions, and authoring integration including Ring-VRF.
- **On-chain Subsystems**: Co-authored and maintaining STF subsystems ensuring Gray Paper compliance as the protocol evolves.

Due to JAM's clean-room implementation requirements, the PolkaJAM repository remains closed source during development. Parity colleagues can review my contributions [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkajam/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavxy).

### Technical Writing

#### Sassafras RFC

I authored [RFC-26](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0026-sassafras-consensus.md), a detailed specification that bridges academic research and practical engineering. The document translates the complex concepts from the Sassafras research paper into concrete implementation guidelines.

It defines the full specification for implementing Sassafras consensus and establishes a potential foundation for next-generation Polkadot rollups to leverage advanced consensus mechanisms.

#### VRF Specifications

I co-authored two specifications that became foundational components of the JAM protocol:

- [**Bandersnatch VRF-AD**](https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec): A comprehensive specification for Verifiable Random Functions with Additional Authenticated Data (VRF-AD), extending IETF ECVRF [RFC-9381](https://https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9381) scheme to support authenticated auxiliary data.
- [**Ring-VRF**](https://github.com/davxy/ring-proof-spec): A technical specification of the W3F's Ring-VRF scheme, enabling anonymous yet verifiable randomness generation within a group of participants.

These specifications serve as a reference for implementing these cryptographic primitives across the JAM ecosystem. The work involved translating cutting-edge cryptographic research into precise, implementable protocols.

I implemented [ark-vrf](https://github.com/davxy/ark-vrf), a production-ready Rust implementation of VRF schemes built over W3F [ring proof](https://github.com/w3f/ring-proof) and [Arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) libraries. This library is currently used by all the JAM teams.

#### JAM Gray Paper

I contribute to the **Gray Paper**, the JAM protocol formal specification. My initial work included inclusion of the Bandersnatch VRF cryptographic primitive description and review of the Safrole authoring section. I now continue to provide general input and review support as the document evolves.

My contributions are available [here](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavxy+).

### Fostering JAM Conformance

I'm helping different teams follow the JAM Gray Paper requirements. This is a basic service and mostly delivered with the distribution of a comprehensive set of **[Test Vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/)** for the JAM STF defined by the Gray Paper. These vectors became a widely accepted reference for JAM implementors and have been instrumental in accelerating interoperability.

I provide ongoing technical support through public channels, focusing on areas within my core expertise including consensus protocols, cryptographic implementations, and Gray Paper interpretation.

I established structured cross-team collaboration workflows through the dedicated JAM [Conformance Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#jam-conformance:matrix.org) and [Conformance Repository](https://github.com/davxy/jam-conformance), which serves as the central coordination hub for:
- Tracking implementation progress across teams
- Disclose fuzzer reports and bug discoveries
- Hosting technical discussions and specification clarifications
- Coordinating cross-team collaboration while respecting clean-room development requirements.

I deliver the data powering the [JAM Conformance Dashboard](https://paritytech.github.io/jam-conformance-dashboard/) that provides critical insights for M1 audit timings. This dashboard enables teams to assess implementations STF execution time to ensure equivalent confidence levels in correctness validation across all implementations.

#### Fuzzing

I developed a fuzzer for JAM Milestone-1 conformance testing. This tool generates randomized inputs to stress-test JAM implementations, systematically discovering edge cases and bugs that manual testing might miss.

The fuzzer has proven highly effective at identifying flaws across multiple implementations, with all findings transparently reported through the aforementioned channels. This quality assurance process is essential for M1 assessment and will likely remain relevant post-production for continuous conformance validation.
