## Evidence

### JAM

- Gray Paper.
  - Actively contributed to and reviewed the Safrole consensus protocol design ([GP acknowledgements](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/blob/main/text/ack.tex)).

- Bandersnatch Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)
  - Co-authored the formal specification of Bandersnatch VRFs with Seyed Hosseini, critical for the cryptographic processes in both the Safrole and Sassafras protocols  ([Specification](https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec), [GP bibliography](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/blob/3222bb39f3d6121c7fe86fa33a9620d43b558476/biblio.bib#L303)).
  - Developed a stand-alone library implementing the specification ([CRATE](https://github.com/davxy/ark-ec-vrfs)).

- Development of JAM's Safrole prototype.

### Polkadot-SDK

- Crypto code refactory.
  - Small refactory to minimize the shared code and reduce the technical debt in the Substrate crypto primitives.
  - PRs: [SDK 3684](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3684), [SDK 3806](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3806)

- Sassafras protocol update.
  - Initiated the overhaul of Sassafras protocol already integrated in the SDK in order to align it with the updates recently introduced in [RFC 26](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/26). In particular this is an effort to reduce the gap between Safrole and Sassafras.
  - PR: [SDK 4373](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4373)

### RFCs

- Resurrect Sassafras
  - The development of Sassafras RFC had been paused during the design phase of the Safrole protocol.
    It has now been updated to incorporate some of the ideas and simplifications introduced by Safrole.
  - PR: [RFC 26](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/26)

### Support and Collaboration

- Review of Polkadot-SDK pull requests that mostly fall within my area of expertise or made by the Node SDK team.
- Active participation in the JAM Gray paper review process.
