## Evidence

Most of my time lately is spent doing research and working on [PolkaVM](https://github.com/koute/polkavm), a next generation virtual machine for PolkaJAM.

More details at:
  - [my post on Polkadot forums](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/announcing-polkavm-a-new-risc-v-based-vm-for-smart-contracts-and-possibly-more/3811),
  - [my talk about PolkaVM at the last year's "The Ultimate Risk: RISC-V" event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5QeOUrjBn4&t=505s),
  - appendix A of the [PolkaJAM graypaper](https://graypaper.com).

Some of my PRs integrating PolkaVM into `polkadot-sdk` an an experimental executor:
