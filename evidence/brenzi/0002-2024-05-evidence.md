## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [ ] Concern(s): 

- [X] Comment(s):
  - I do not take a salary from Encointer Association. Therefore, no treasury grants that went to Encointer went into the efforts listed above. 
  - I'm de-facto code owner of a systemchain (Encointer) since its first block. My dedication to Encointer and its runtime will be unaffected by whatever rank the fellowship grants me.
  - Given a higher rank, I could help accelerate progress of systemchain runtimes by providing reviews in my field of expertise
