## Argument
I have been a core contributor to Polkadot's staking subsystem since September 2022. I was inducted into the Fellowship in November 2023 and became eligible for promotion to Rank II in November 2024. I missed the January 2025 evidence deadline and was demoted shortly after. I take full responsibility for the missed submission.

Since my last report, Iâ€™ve continued working as part of the two-person core staking team, focusing on the design and development of the asynchronous staking module across Asset Hub and the Relay Chain. I led most of the architectural design work and jointly handled the implementation, which is now code-complete and pending further testing and audit before rollout to Mainnet.

This module is foundational for Plaza and JAM and represents substantial protocol design, development, and maintenance work. Given the scope and impact of my recent work, I believe it aligns with the expectations for Rank II. I respectfully request the fellows to consider promoting me to Rank II. That said, I understand the circumstances around my demotion and will fully accept the fellowship judgment if I am asked to resume from Rank I.
