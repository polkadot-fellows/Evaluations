## Evidence

In the current reporting period I have focused on the design and implementation of Elastic Scaling
while doing some team management activities at Parity.

### Elastic scaling MVP

I worked on the launch of the first iteration of elastic scaling on test networks and Kusama:
https://forum.polkadot.network/t/elastic-scaling-mvp-launched/9392

### Elastic scaling

I researched and created a development plan to push forward the elastic scaling implementation
and capabilities: https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/119/views/25.

As a first step I was major driver and contributor to [RFC 103](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0103-introduce-core-index-commitment.md)
as a solution to fix some of the security limitations of the MVP implementation.

Contributor to the implementation in the runtime and some of the node subsystems:

- [Introduce the new Polkadot primitives](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5044)
- [Node feature sanity checks](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5362)
- [Full Runtime implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5423)
- [Bootstrap node implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5679).
- [Candidate Validation](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5847)
- [Statement Distribution](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5883)
