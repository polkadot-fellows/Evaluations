## Evidence

During the reporting period, I was busy pushing forward the PolkaVM integration: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704

That included filing and getting approved RFC-135: https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/135

The implementation of said RFC is already a part of the PolkaVM integration PR: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704/commits/66eb9d961eb2804fccdb767e20f23e675779f901

Besides that, I started my way toward implementing the long-awaited RFC-4: https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/4

As the first step, I picked up a relevant but stale PR and revived it, and now I'm collecting reviews for that breaking runtime interface change: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7375

I have also worked on NFT throughput benchmarking for specific cases involving large chain states and have created some tooling to support that need: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/tree/s0me0ne/ethereum2 , https://github.com/s0me0ne-unkn0wn/state-bloater/tree/master .
That work is still ongoing, and the benchmarking results will be available later soon.

To sum up, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and thus, I'm applying for retention at Rank I.
