## Evidence

During the reporting period, I was busy pushing forward the [PolkaVM integration](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704).
That included filing and getting approved [RFC-135](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/135), which standardized binary blob prefixes to make it possible to use different execution engines effectively.
The implementation of said RFC is already a part of the [PolkaVM integration PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704/commits/66eb9d961eb2804fccdb767e20f23e675779f901).
That is a valuable contribution as it paves the way to more performant and deterministic execution, thus making Polkadot more secure. It also agrees with principles or JAM, which will use PolkaVM as a main execution engine.

Besides that, I started my way toward implementing the long-awaited [RFC-4](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/4) which will enable in-runtime allocation, making runtime execution faster and solving some significant problems regarding execution determinism.
As the first step, I picked up a relevant but stale [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7375) and revived it, and now I'm collecting reviews for that breaking runtime interface change.

I have also worked on NFT throughput benchmarking for specific cases involving large chain states and have created some tooling to support that need: [a specialized version of the sTPS tool](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-stps/tree/s0me0ne/ethereum2) and a simple [state bloater](https://github.com/s0me0ne-unkn0wn/state-bloater/tree/master).
That is crucial to prevent future problems that could emerge in parachains with quickly growing state size. For the same reason, I [proposed increasing the PoV size on Polkadot to 10 MiB](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1480).

To sum up, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and thus, I'm applying for retention at Rank I.
