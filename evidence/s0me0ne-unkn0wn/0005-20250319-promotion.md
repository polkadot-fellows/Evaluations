## Evidence

Dear fellows,

According to the Manifesto, a rank II member should be a core part of the team, clearly demonstrate the knowledge of the protocol, communicate, share knowledge, become deeply familiar with a major area of the protocol, and should not be asking dumb questions. Well, I have to confess, I'm still doing the latter.

Otherwise, before joining the Fellowship and during a year of being a rank I member, I developed solid familiarity with the PVF execution pipeline[^6161][^98][^3139][^1192], WebAssembly[^nok][^exec][^6918][^13811], and PolkaVM[^10], as a major area of the Polkadot protocol. I shared my research and knowledge[^sl][^1343] on the problem of execution determinism as much as I could. I communicated with most of you directly or indirectly, hopefully making me a core part of the team. I also filed RFC-135[^135] proposing a change to the protocol, which has been approved and implemented as a part of ongoing PolkaVM integration PR[^pvm].

Therefore, I am applying for the promotion to rank II member. I would lay my right hand on the spec to swear loyalty, but we don't have a spec (see "Concerns" section below).

Sincerely yours,
Someone Unknown

## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [x] Concern(s): 
While working on RFC-135, I found out we don't have a solid up to date protocol spec. I find the matter really disturbing and worth discussing, and I would like to speak up on that topic at the next in-person Fellowship meeting.
