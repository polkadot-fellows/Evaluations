## Argument

During the reporting period, I took over [RFC-4](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/4) by re-creating it as [RFC-145](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/145) and started implementing it as two separate PRs: [#8641](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8641) (proposing new host functions implementations, could be safely backported to existing stable releases) and [#8866](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8866) (where breaking changes requiring a new stable release reside). Implementing that long-awaited RFC will dramatically improve execution determinism and is also essential from the perspective of smart contracts' security.

Further, I'm still progressing with the [PolkaVM integration](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704), which now relies on the aforementioned RFC-4 implementation. Having PolkaVM-enabled parachain runtimes will, among other things, allow us to lower the parachain deposits and improve the ecosystem's availability to developers.

Additionally, I conducted extensive TPS benchmarking for specific cases, including multi-core parachains, both Polkadot-native and EVM-based.

To summarize, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and therefore, I'm applying for retention at Rank II.
