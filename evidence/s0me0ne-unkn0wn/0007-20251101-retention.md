## Argument

I was busy working on [RFC-145](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/145), polishing its implementation ([#8641](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8641) and [#8866](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8866)) and addressing review comments. By now, it's ready for review, and I encourage all fellows with host function-related expertise to review the work ASAP. We want this RFC implemented to improve execution determinism and performance.

I also published [RFC-156](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/156), which proposes adding BLS12-381 host functions (the underlying logic was already implemented by @drskalman and @davxy). The functions are required to equip BEEFY with BLS signatures, which are essential for the accountable light client protocol. It is important to bundle RFC-156 with RFC-145 to set a consistent memory allocation strategy for new host functions.

Further, I supported the Spammening and throughput benchmarking related work and modified the YAP runtime to include the collator selection pallet ([#9663](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9663)). While working on that, I discovered and fixed a critical bug in Aura consensus implementation ([#9753](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9753))

Additionally, I'm keeping the [PolkaVM integration PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704) up to date so it could be used as soon as RFC-145 is adopted.

To summarize, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and therefore, I'm applying for retention at Rank II.
