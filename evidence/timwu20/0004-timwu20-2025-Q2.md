## Argument

Started work on integration our version of `TrieDB` into the Gossamer codebase.  The introduction of `api.Backend` interface and the implementation in `db.Backend` was completed in [PR #4405](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4405), which utilizes `StateDB` and `blockchainDB` as primary dependencies.  A `Client` was introduced that is the entrypoint to all things coupled with blockchain state storage and block history was completed in [PR #4477](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4477). A design doc describing the migration/upgrade path given the existing Gossamer codebase was documented in [PR #4441](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4441).

After completing the `Client` I shifted focus back to GRANDPA integration utilizing the new `Client` which is documented in [PR #4519](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4519).  Given the nature of the GRANDPA client integration in Substrate I focused on introducing interfaces that were analgous to `Network` and `Syncing` traits along with an implementation of `GossipEngine` in [PR #4572](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4572).  With these interfaces in place, I was able to to introduce the GRANDPA `networkBridge` in [PR #4604](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4604), the `environment` in [PR #4652](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4652), `voterWork` in [PR #4755](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4755), and `BlockImport` in [PR #4762](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4762).  Work was left off here given the result of treasury proposals to fund continued work on the Gossamer project.
