## Evidence

Hi all, hope you are well. Here's the contributions that I've made to polkadot-sdk recently.
I look forward to seeing you at Polkadot decoded 2024!

## Q1-Q2 2024 Code Contributions

Slightly made it nicer to construct clients:

- [Extract PartialComponents into a type alias](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/2767)

(I forget who suggested this but it was not my own inspiration)

### Removal of sp-std

I'm reducing references to the sp-std crate gradually with a view to removing it:

- [removed 2021 core prelude](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4183)
- [removal from primitives](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3274)
- [removal from some of frame](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3199)

### Tracing

I am investigating adding structured logging to substrate. In preperation these improvements have been made:

- [Removed redundant logging code](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4059)
- [Major bumped tracing-subscriber](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3891) 

### Misc

I have watched or join most of the monthly fellowship calls. I wish to retain my current rank.

(Any fellowship salary to me would get heavily taxed so I choose to forgo any fellowship salary at this time.)
