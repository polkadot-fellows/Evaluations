## Evidence
I believe my contributions over the past period demonstrate my commitment to Polkadot's development and are in accordance with a Rank I member of The Fellowship.

Grateful that I have been active in adding new features and collaborated with some higher ranked members of the fellowship, their guidiance has been invaluable to me.

### Features
Adding the [Secretary collective](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/347) to the Collective System chain.

### Mainteinance
Refactoring the storage traits, with V1 pallet syntax removed the `generator` traits and method should be moved to `types` directory [[FRAME] Cleanup storage generator types](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5408).

Members should not be required to manually call `bump` to begin the next salaly cycle, this adds a service task [Task(bump) Pallet Salary](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5163). 

In the future I aim to take on more design decisions regarding FRAME.

Still a lot to learn, overall I am enjoying my experience working with the Polkadot Ecosystem.
