## Argument
### 1. Contributions to the Tooling Collective and Member Management
During this reporting period, I worked on configurations for the tooling collective which led me to identify and resolved a critical benchmarking mismatch in `pallet_core_fellowship` generating invalid ranks exceeding runtime-configured `MaxRank` values ([#7720](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7720)). This manifested specifically in edge cases like `MaxRank=1`.

The solution implements dynamic rank clamping via `r.min(T::MaxRank::get())`, enforcing runtime constraints while preserving backward compatibility with type-safe conversions via `ConvertU16ToU32`.

I am currently investigating same benchmarking patterns in `pallet_treasury` to ensure consistent rank handling across collectives.

### 2. Developer Relations
Continue to proactively strengthened developer engagement through hands-on mentorship with the study group.

Some contributor highlights this period include [Nathy-bajo](https://github.com/Nathy-bajo) and his contribution adding view functions to the Proxy pallet for runtime-specific type configuration([#7320](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7320)) along side other maintenance contributions.

[Runcomet's](https://github.com/runcomet) creation of [genesis dev accounts](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6267) and ongoing implementation of [RFC 0097](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7398).

#### Next Phase
Moving forward I will be taking the study group public through the Polkadot Africa initiative and look forward to fostering developers in the ecosystem, combining online sessions and in-person workshops to scale developer onboarding across traditional tech communities and undergraduate programs.

### 3. Contributions on the Accounting System(`pallet-balances`)

Improved the accounting system of the balances pallet, modifying [event emision](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7250) to enable reliable balances reconciliation of the Burn/Mint operations and Hold/release Operations.


I humbly request for retention at Rank I.
