## Argument
### Ambassador Fellowship Configuration
During this reporting period, I spearheaded the [implementation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/736) of the Ambassador Fellowship's new [technical specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9O8AoRx-4g0kAwOZAEblTu8RSAUgnqNSzie_TXy0go/edit?tab=t.y6mnd3cxgh81). This involved aligning the fellowship's operational requirements with Substrate's runtime constraints.

Enabling permissionless onboarding at Rank 0 through `InductionDeposit`, which required reconfiguring both `pallet-core-fellowship` and `pallet-ranked-fellowship` and ensuring comprehensive benchmark coverage.

Currently confirming existing [members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13p5v1hs98Hcz01va6IYN8HM2AAZEJ9zMkZYgl2pkxnw/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to migrate into the on-chain collective.

### Ecosystem Infrastructure Standardization
Introduced `GetInto`, a generic converter for the Get trait that leverages `Into` for type-safe conversions. The utility of this solution exceeds the initial pull request of concern, as discussed in the [comments](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-common/pull/909#issuecomment-2812549080).

By establishing this standardized approach, we've eliminated redundant code while improving efficiency in core components like XCMP and governance modules.


I humbly request for retention at Rank I.
