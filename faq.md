# FAQ

## Voting records
1. I am not a Fellow, do I have voting rights?

Yes. All Fellowship members have voting rights. Rank 1 members can vote on referenda posted on the [`Members`](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/tracks/1) track. Rank 2 members can vote on any referenda posted on the [`Members`](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/tracks/1) and [`Proficient Members`](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/tracks/2) tracks. 

2. Where can I see my voting record?

Currently, there is no UI/aggregator that provides custom voting records for members. This means that members have to crunch the existing data on Fellowship referenda (<u>taking into consideration their rank and their reporting period</u>) to work out their voting activity rate or voting agreement rate.

3. Where can I see existing data for Fellowship referenda?

All information about Fellowship referenda can be found on [Polkadot-JS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fsys.ibp.network%2Fcollectives-polkadot#/fellowship/referenda), [Polkassembly](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/), and [Subsquare](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship). Generally-speaking, it is much easier to access, cross-reference, and review this data from Subsquare. 

4. Which data do I need to mention in my voting record?

Members of Rank 1-2 will need to include data about voting activity in % (i.e Out of all the referenda in which you were eligible to vote, on how many did you cast your vote?). 
Members of Rank 3-6 will need to include data about voting agreement in % (i.e Out of all the referenda in which members of higher ranks were in complete agreement, on how many did you cast your vote in line with the consensus?) <u>in addition to the above</u>.

5. How do I submit my voting record?

You can use the ‘voting record’ section of the [evidence report template](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/Evaluations/blob/main/0000-evidence-template.md).

6. I forgot to include my voting record but my retention/promotion proposal is already up for vote. What do I do?

You can log into [Subsquare](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship) and post a comment on the on-chain proposal to submit your voting record. 


## In-person interviews

1. Do I need to attend an interview?

You will need to attend an in-person interview whenever you are seeking to be promoted to Rank 3, 4, 5, and 6.

2. What is the process for attending in-person interviews?

If you are seeking promotion to Ranks 3+, you will need to:
- Make sure that your [promotion period](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/core) has elapsed
- Check that there is plenty of time left on your [demotion period](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/core)
- Open a PR to submit your [evidence report](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/Evaluations/blob/main/0000-evidence-template.md) for promotion
- Submit a sub-treasury proposal to obtain funding for interview-related costs (optional)
- Attend the interview and demonstrate all the requirements for promotion to the requested rank. The on-chain proposal may be submitted on-chain during or after this interview.

3. What if I need to reschedule my in-person interview? 

Make sure to contact Rank 5+ members ASAP to agree on a new date and time. If you are unable to secure a new interview and your demotion period is ending in less than 30 days, you must submit a request for retention at your current rank <u>so that you do not become liable for demotion</u>. This also means that you will need to postpone your request for promotion.
