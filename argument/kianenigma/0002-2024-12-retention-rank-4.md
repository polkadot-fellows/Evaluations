## Evidence

* Maintenance of FRAME ([eg](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5995)), Polkadot-SDK templates ([eg](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5242)), and new components such as the [`OmniNode`](https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/157/views/1) and its [api docs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6094).
* Abundant mentorship either through position at Parity, and or participating (free of charge) in PBA(X) program.
* Ample reviews on the Staking system ([e.g.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6034)) + [Inflation](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/443) system.
* While bandwidth is limited, I am attempting to guide developers into [materializing OPF](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/375), which has passed WFC track.
* Retention and dissemination of core Polkadot knowledge, including JAM:
    * Demystifying JAM - [Blog](https://blog.kianenigma.com/posts/tech/demystifying-jam/) / [Presentation](https://blog.kianenigma.com/posts/tech/demystifying-jam/presentation/), which has been featured in many places, including [`@govofyork`'s X account](https://x.com/gavofyork/status/1860633087136178639), [Parity's blog](https://www.parity.io/blog/JAM-demystified-explainer), and [Polkadot X account](https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1861008901606391826), and 
    * [Blockchain Scalability](https://blog.kianenigma.com/blockchain-reimagined/presentation-tum/) - TUM Munich Blockchain Conference
    * [Polkadot-SDK Features Overview in 2024](https://blog.kianenigma.com/talks/frame-2024/)
* Exploring new FRAME ideas such as [FLITE](https://github.com/kianenigma/flite), which have been a [source of inspiration](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/issues/257#issuecomment-2278749395) for [OpenZeppelin templates](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-runtime-templates/pull/300).

## Misc

- Comment(s): 
Being in a position of leadership within both Parity and the ecosystem, I want to acknowledge that some of the work that I named above is achieved with the help of other individuals, and I played the role of a mentor/coordinator. I am grateful to work with all of the with other Parity employees and Fellowship members, for example @ggwpez to name one.
- I will strive to improve my voting rate, and apply for a promotion to Rank 5 in June 2025. I will still retain my part time salary only. My main intention to promote myself would be to eligible to vote on more proposals, and remove the burden on the current rank 5+ members for promotions to rank 3+, and so on.
