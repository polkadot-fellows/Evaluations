## Evidence

Over the past three months, my primary focus has been working on on-demand and Coretime.

Specifically I have worked on implementing on-demand credits on the relay chain side. The work can be seen in this PR: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5990

I am currently developing on-demand integration modules to facilitate development for projects adopting the on-demand Coretime model for their parachain.

I also identified an issue with cross-chain transfers of Coretime regions on Polkadot and Kusama and created a PR to resolve it: [link](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/483)
