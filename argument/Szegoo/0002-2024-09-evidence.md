## Evidence

Over the past three months, my primary focus has been on RegionX, a project closely tied to Polkadot.

My main contribution has been completing the Coretime auto-renew feature:

https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4424
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5067

I’ve also been actively following Coretime development and recently identified an issue in the sale configuration prior to its launch on Polkadot: https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1172

During this period, I have been quite occupied and, as a result, was unable to contribute as much as I had in the past.

As a result, I have not claimed a salary.
