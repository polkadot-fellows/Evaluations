## Argument

Consistent with the evaluative standards defined for Rank II in the [Fellowship Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.pdf), this Argument synthesises my technical contributions over the reporting period, demonstrating continued proficiency and dedication to the Polkadot core infrastructure.

### Core Protocol Maintenance

This period, I focused on significant maintenance work within the `polkadot-sdk` and the `runtimes`, ensuring the long-term sustainability and cleanliness of the codebase.

- **Migration to `fungible` Traits**: I led the effort to migrate `pallet-treasury` to use `fungible` traits, replacing the deprecated `Currency` trait. This work also involved removing the legacy `Proposals` and `spend_local` systems ([polkadot-sdk#11109](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/11109)). This is a critical step in the broader [Token Horizon](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/226) project to modernize token handling across all pallets, and it unblocks some existing and further migrations, including my own work on `pallet-identity` ([polkadot-sdk#9589](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9859)), still under review. Also, this means an effort to remove legacy codebase from critical pallets like Treasury.

- **Runtime Upgrades**: I contributed with the migration of the Fellowship Runtimes to `stable2512` ([runtimes#1065](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/1065)). This migration unlocks new capabilities for the Polkadot Ecosystem and ensures our runtimes remain up-to-date with the latest stable release standards.

These contributions demonstrate my ability to handle complex refactoring tasks and maintain critical system components, aligning with the Rank II requirement for proficient technical contribution.

### Ongoing Research & Future Work

In addition to my direct protocol contributions, I am currently working on an academic paper exploring the potential of JAM as a robust Edge computing platform. While the draft is still internal, my preliminary research bibliography can be found in this [Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6403108/blockchain__jam__wasm-to-pvm). I look forward to sharing the completed preprint with the Fellowship in the near future.
