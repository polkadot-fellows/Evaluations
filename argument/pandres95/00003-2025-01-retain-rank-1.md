## Evidence

This quarter, I focused on refining core contributions in **assets, governance, and runtime upgrades**. The work highlights both the continued refinement of past contributions and the initiation of new projects aligned with Polkadot's vision for the future with the Hub.

### **Assets**

#### **Finalization of `pallet-assets-holder`**

- Finalized **`pallet-assets-holder`** ([PSDK #4530](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4530)), ensuring a **stable and feature-complete** integration within the Polkadot SDK.
- Incorporated final review feedback and refinements to enhance **functionality, security, and maintainability**.

#### **Draft for `pallet-assets-vesting`**

- Initiated the draft for **`pallet-assets-vesting`** ([PSDK #7404](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404)), introducing a **`fungibles`-compatible subsystem for asset-based vesting** within Polkadot.
- This extension enables **time-based linear asset distribution**, expanding Polkadot's **financial tooling** for Asset Hub and the parachains.

### **Governance**

#### **Integration of Iterable Tracks for Kitchensink using `pallet-parameters`**

- Completed the **Proof of Concept** for Iterable Referenda Tracks by integrating **Iterable Tracks** in `kitchensink` using **`dynamic-parameters`** ([PSDK #2072](https://github.com/polkadot-sdk/pull/2072)).
  - This implementation **demonstrates track adaptability** using the existing toolset, showcasing it meets the required design goals.
  - The Iterable Referenda Tracks RFC ([RFC #121](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/121)) establishes a **structured framework** for introducing iterable governance tracks, making **on-chain decision-making more dynamic and parameter-driven**. I invite fellows to review it.

### **Runtime Upgrades & Maintenance**

#### **Participation in Runtime Upgrades to Latest Stable SDK**

- Successfully merged the upgrade to **`stable2409-2`** to Runtimes ([`runtimes#490`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/490)), ensuring compatibility with the **latest stable SDK**.
- Successfully merged the minor upgrade to **`stable2409-4`** ([`runtimes#568`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/568)), which will further **enhance runtime stability**.
- These updates are a stepping stone towards **1.4.0 release preparation**.

#### **Set Burn Parameters for Kusama Treasury to be handled via OpenGov**

- Following a community request ([Kusama WFC #437](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/437)), I implemented a helper structure that enables OpenGov to set the parameters for treasury Burn, following the deactivation of the Burn being sent to Kappa Sigma Mu ([runtimes#511](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/511)).

## **Conclusion**

This quarter, my contributions focused on strengthening Polkadot's governance, assets, and runtime infrastructure. The finalization of `pallet-assets-holder` and progress on `pallet-assets-vesting` enhance financial tooling for parachains, while the integration of Iterable Tracks improves governance adaptability. Additionally, stable runtime upgrades ensure continued protocol stability and efficiency.

Looking ahead, I will continue refining governance tooling, supporting collective initiatives, and expanding my contributions to XCM and bridges. My focus remains on delivering impactful protocol enhancements that improve usability, security, and interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem.
