## Argument

As technical lead of the Gossamer project I am comitted to delivering an alternative validator node written in Go for the Polkadot ecosystem.  I have continued working on the integration of our version of `TrieDB` into the Gossamer codebase, which has resulted in us trying to create a Substrate like `Client` type that incorporates `TrieDB` through it's own dependencies.

I started worked on recreating the `StateDb` type first found in `sc_state_db` by first implementing the pruning maintenance in [PR #3956](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/3956), and implementing the non-canonical overlays in [PR #3951](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/3951).  The work in these two PRs were used to create our own `StateDB` componenent in [PR #3967](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/3967).

After that I moved onto another dependency of the `Client` which is the `BlockchainDb` type found in the `sc_client_db` crate.  This type is the persisted database for block headers and the [PR #4015](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4015) also introduces a number of primitives that are Substrate compatible.

Further work was required to our `TrieDB` component to support the iteration use cases that would be needed by the future work related to the `Client`, as well as introducing a memory backed version of `HashDB`.  This work can be found in [PR #4315](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4315).

We ended up creating our own version of `TrieBackend` from `sp_state_machine` in [PR #4318](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4318) which utilizes `TrieDB` now backed by `HashDB`. In substrate the `TrieBackend` is utlized by `sc_client_db::Backend` which is the chief dependency of the Substrate `Client`.  

The work to incorporate `TrieBackend` and `BlockchainDB` into our version of `sc_client_db::Backend` can be found in [PR #4405](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer/pull/4405).  We also introduced a public `api.Backend` interface which is analagous to `sc_client_api::Backend`.
