## Evidence
In the last three months since I applied for the fellowship, I have further pushed the transition of the network to Agile Coretime. This has been a very satisfying project that I have worked on for nearly a year now and have brought the Coretime Chain to reality, playing a key role in the transition to Agile Coretime across Rococo, Westend, Kusama and now Polkadot. In this reporting period I prepared and submitted the referenda to register and onboard the Polkadot Coretime Chain and carry out the migration to Agile Coretime on Polkadot.

In the last three months I have been very active in the Agile Coretime project, in particular with the addition of the Polkadot Coretime Chain in [runtimes#410](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/410), but also with improvements, fixes, solving issues raised during audit, reviews, as well as doing much of the end to end testing and preparation of Referenda. While stress testing the runtimes I uncovered some limitations in the scheduler, potentially leading to inconsistent state and parachains stalling. I also discovered a smaller issue with one of the XCMs communicating across the `CoretimeInterface`. I wrote these up and proposed two fixes, before implementing them in time for the v1.3.0 release.

I played a supporting role in the deployment of the People chain on Polkadot, preparing the production runtime and chain specs and testing the migration of state and the referenda. 

On top of engineering and design, I am an active and regular reviewer in both the `polkadot-sdk` and `runtimes` repo, as well as carrying out maintenance in these two repositories aside from my regular contributions.

Code and review contributions since my last report can be found on my GitHub profile [`seadanda`](https://github.com/seadanda), but date-filtered links are below for the two most relevant repos:
- [`polkadot-sdk`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pulls?q=is:pr+author:seadanda+merged:%3E%3D2024-06-02)
- [`runtimes`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pulls?q=is:pr+author:seadanda+merged:%3E%3D2024-06-02)
Reviews:
- [`polkadot-sdk`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Aseadanda)
- [`runtimes`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Aseadanda)

In the last few months I continued with my interest in speaking publicly about the projects that I work on, giving another talk about Agile Coretime at Polkadot Decoded in Brussels. This time I took advantage of the rising levels of understanding of Agile Coretime in the ecosystem and spoke specifically about its economics, the aims of the price model and my vision of future developments. The talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPW4QygdsTU) Along these same lines I have engaged with developers and members of community projects seeking to understand more about Agile Coretime; both on a conceptual level, and also more specifically about integrating with it. I am active on Matrix and the Polkadot Forum, and aim to improve my presence on the forum going forward.

Recently my focus has turned to the realisation of RFC-32 - minimal relay. I have been working as part of a team in Parity to plan the project of moving Staking, Governance and Balances to Asset Hub and starting to work out the technical details, and I plan to continue working on this effort in the coming months.
