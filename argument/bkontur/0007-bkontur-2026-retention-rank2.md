## Argument

This summary outlines my activities, contributions, and collaborations during the reporting period.

At the beginning of the reporting period, I provided limited support for the Asset Hub Migration (AHM), mainly through PR reviews and handling last-minute issues. This included, for example, updating weights for the Polkadot runtimes [[1]](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/959), fixing minor issues [[2]](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/971), and reporting problems identified during benchmarking [[3]](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/972).

I switched my focus fully to the **Bulletin Chain**. The Bulletin Chain is designed to provide ephemeral storage and to support one of the initial Proof-of-Personhood (PoP) features, while also being extensible to other Web3 applications and use cases.

My work has focused on leading and supporting the delivery of the Bulletin Chain, including issue handling, improvements, releases, planning, and coordination of deployments. This naturally resulted in less direct coding and fewer PRs from my side, and more emphasis on planning and design. Examples include issues I created and linked ([issues](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-bulletin-chain/issues?q=author%3Abkontur%20created%3A2025-10-05..2026-01-02)), as well as ([smaller PRs](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-bulletin-chain/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abkontur+created%3A2025-10-05..2026-01-02)).
We successfully launched the Bulletin Chain as a solochain ([https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fbulletin.rpc.amforc.com#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fbulletin.rpc.amforc.com#/explorer)) and are also prototyping a Polkadot parachain-like deployment. I created and managed the work enabling the chain to run as a parachain ([PR #10662](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10662)), which consists of three sub-PRs. Thanks also to [Iulian](https://github.com/iulianbarbu) for one of the sub-PRs and to [Basti](https://github.com/bkchr) for review and merge support.

In addition, we are working on providing various examples and integrations, including IPFS, Bitswap, and smoldot ([smoldot PR #2189](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot/pull/2189)).
Beyond this, I deepened my expertise in **IPFS/Bitswap**, identifying protocol gaps and reporting issues to [Dmitry Markin](https://github.com/dmitry-markin), as well as contributing to **litep2p** (for example, very small contributions [here](https://github.com/paritytech/litep2p/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abkontur+created%3A2025-10-05..2026-01-02)).

Beyond these major areas, I continue to support the ecosystem through code reviews, mentorship, and cross-team collaboration.
