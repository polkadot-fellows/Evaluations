## Evidence

Examples of architectural and design work I participated in as required for rank 4:

- [on-demand cumulus integration](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/1487)
- [more resilient collator protocol](https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/36/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=30536363)
- [New disabling strategy](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/784#issuecomment-1691886382)
- [New price controller for Agile Coretime](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4521)
- [time-disputes](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/742#issuecomment-1691884835),
  a bit older but I believe interesting as it can fully solve security issues with
  indeterminism in a sharded network.
