## Evidence
My sole code contribution this time, was identifying, reproducing, and fixing a bug in the polkadot-sdk, which resulted in a build error under some circumstances due to an unhygenic widely-used macro, namely the `format_runtime_string!` macro, see the fix in [PR #5632](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5632). This bug has indeed affected some parachain teams, and was backported into both `stable2407` and `stable2409`.

I don't have any other hard evidence, but naturally, I have continued staying active in the ecosystem mostly as parachain a builder in Encointer, Integritee and Ajuna.

## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [ ] Concern(s): 

- [x] Comment(s):
    * As mentioned above, I was unaware that I can vote on referenda with rank I. I am now monitoring the referenda to prevent this from happening again.
    * Even though I am only rank I and I consider the bugfix above quite valuable, I think I should have more evidences (although my total salary claimed is still low with 3.33K USDT). I have periodically been checking for other small issues in the relevant repositories, but couldn't find suitable ones. I will become more proactive in the community to identify my proper role in the fellowship.
