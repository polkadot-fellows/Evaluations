## Evidence

### PolkaJam

Throughout this period, my primary efforts have been dedicated to developing
Parity's JAM prototype, *PolkaJam*.

While the PolkaJam codebase is not yet publicly available, Parity fellows can
review my contributions to the
[project repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkajam/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adavxy).
For others, my work on STF test vector proposals highlights my commitment to
fostering interoperability across [JAM teams](https://graypaper.com/clients/).

### Test Vectors

I proposed additional test vectors aligned with the requirements of milestone
1 (M1).

Details can be found in the [tracking issue](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/issues/21). The new vectors address the following areas:
- **Authorization queues management** (GP section 8)
- **Reporting and Assurances** (GP section 11)
- **WR Accumulation** (GP section 12)
- **Preimages management** (GP section 12)
- **Validators activity statistics** (GP section 13)

These additions complete the coverage of all state transition
function (STF) subsystems. For ease of use by implementers,
all the proposed vectors were included in a single comprehensive
[PR](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/28).

### Bandersnatch VRFs

I refined the Bandersnatch VRF cryptographic
[library](https://github.com/davxy/ark-ec-vrfs) and successfully published the
first release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ark-ec-vrfs).
As far as I know, this library is currently used by all JAM teams.

### Support and Collaboration

Provided occasional support to JAM implementers in the JAM public channels,
primarily addressing topics within my areas of expertise.
