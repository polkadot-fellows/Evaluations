## Evidence

### JAM

As a member of Parity's *PolkaJam* team, I've been heavily involved in the
development of Parity's JAM prototype. This also includes refining auxiliary
specifications and generating test vectors essential for achieving our interoperability
goals across all [JAM teams](https://graypaper.com/clients/).

- Proposed [test vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pulls?q=type%3Apr+author%3Adavxy++Safrole++in%3Atitle) for the *Safrole* subsystem STF.
- Proposed [test vectors](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors/pull/9) for the *Disputes* subsystem STF.

### Crypto Primitives

Together with the W3F research team, I contributed to the development of a formal
[Ring-Proof specification](https://github.com/davxy/ring-proof-spec) to address gaps
left by the [Bandersnatch VRFs specification](https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec),
particularly regarding the ring-proof details, which were previously left open.

After stabilizing the Bandersnatch VRFs formal specification, I contributed to
the development of the [test vectors](https://github.com/davxy/bandersnatch-vrfs-spec/tree/main/vectors)
for both the IETF and Ring VRFs, which are utilized across our future applications.

### Polkadot-SDK

The Sassafras FRAME code has been finalized and is currently pending review:
[SDK 4373](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4373).

### RFCs

Successfully merged Sassafras [RFC 26](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/26),
which will be instrumental for future parachains that plan to integrate this new consensus protocol.

### Support and Collaboration

- Reviews of Polkadot-SDK pull requests, particularly those within my area of expertise or submitted by the Node SDK team.
