### Impact

These are projects with major milestones where I've played a critical role in:

- [BEEFY consensus protocol](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/client/consensus/beefy/README.md), now live on [Kusama](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/343) and [Polkadot](https://twitter.com/polkaworld_org/status/1779882346180960406), eagerly awaited by the ecosystem with plenty of [hype](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/4641270690713) and [excitement](https://polkadotters.medium.com/from-kusama-to-polkadot-beefy-protocol-set-to-standardize-cross-chain-consensus-1e836bce774b) generated.
- [Polkadot <> Kusama trustless bridge](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/bridges), now [live on Polkadot and Kusama Bridge Hubs](https://twitter.com/TheDotsMagazine/status/1777351423748870347), and [integrated with Asset Hubs](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-kusama-bridge/2971/25) so that [DOT and KSM can flow](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-kusama-bridge/2971/31) between the two networks as dApps are [already adding support](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-kusama-bridge/2971/40) for it.
- [Polkadot <> Ethereum trustless bridge](https://docs.snowbridge.network/concepts), now [initializing on Polkadot](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob/status/1783768045669826914) (under vote in OpenGov).
- Push for [better runtimes testing](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/171#issuecomment-1935532409), adding [cross-chain XCM e2e tests to fellowship](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/103), personally [adding 17 new e2e cross-chain complex assets transfers tests](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/commits/master/cumulus/parachains/integration-tests/emulated/tests) for a current total of 30 scenarios.
