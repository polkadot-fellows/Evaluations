## Argument

During this reporting period, I led a team to create the JAM client **Boka**, focusing our efforts on the PVM recompiler and the guaranteeing process as defined in the JAM graypaper.

Simultaneously, I architected and guided the first release of [PVQ](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/PVQ), defining its modular interfaces and delivering a full end-to-end demonstration. This work creates a foundation to be able to define standardized interfaces for client to access onchain data. Then we can build chain-abstraction layers and make multi-chain applications easier to build and maintain. As part of the demo, we will create a multi-chain Swap UI showcasing this.

To ensure these components remain robust, I have continuously maintained the [polkadot-ecosystem-tests](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/polkadot-ecosystem-tests) suite—reviewing community pull requests, resolving issues, and updating test scenarios to reflect the latest runtime and XCM changes—and overseen upkeep of **Chopsticks** to guarantee local multi-chain environments mirror production behavior. These infrastructure contributions accelerate CI workflows today and smooth the path for seamless network upgrades and onboarding of new builders tomorrow.

Finally, I actively participate in peer review across Polkadot-SDK and related repositories—providing detailed feedback on pull requests, issues, and RFCs—and engage in JAM working-group discussions on Matrix and Discord.
