## Misc

- Comment(s): 

Here are some reasons of why I did not vote for a referendum:
- Invalid referenda that asked people to not vote
- RFCs that are outside of my area of expertise
- Some retain/promote proposals for members that I never reviewed their work
- Lack of time to review & verify the referenda

Will try to improve my voting records by:
- Be more active on RFCs and expand my area of expertise
- Spend more time reviewing PRs
- Improve toolings to make verifing complicated proposals (e.g. a complicated XCM call) easier
