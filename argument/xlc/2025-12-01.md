## Argument

During this reporting period, I led a team to create the JAM client **Boka**, focusing our efforts on ensuring compatibility with the latest test vectors and fuzzing tools.

I continued to look for ways to improve the code quality of Polkadot, including creating the [AI Review Bot](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/actions/workflows/ai-review.yml) to help review PRs.

To keep these components robust, I have continuously maintained the [polkadot-ecosystem-tests](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/polkadot-ecosystem-tests) suite—reviewing community pull requests, resolving issues, and updating test scenarios to reflect the latest runtime and XCM changes—and overseen the upkeep of **Chopsticks** to ensure local multi-chain environments mirror production behavior. These infrastructure contributions accelerate CI workflows today and smooth the path for seamless network upgrades and onboarding of new builders tomorrow.

Finally, I actively participate in peer review across Polkadot-SDK and related repositories—providing detailed feedback on pull requests, issues, and RFCs—and engage in JAM working-group discussions.
