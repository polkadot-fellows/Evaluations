## Argument

### Rank I requirements (Manifesto)

1. Three clear examples of a modest but substantial contribution to protocol development.
2. Actively been involved in the design of a component. The component should be either deployed into the protocol or reasonably intended for future deployment into protocol and at the standard expected of a PRP.
3. Substantially assisted in the analysis, or authoring of formalisation or implementation of a protocol component. Formalisation should be at the standard expected of a peer-reviewed publication. Analysis should either lead to a change in the protocol or be at the standard expected of a PRP. Implementation should be in a functional implementation of the protocol.
4. Should be able to list all key goals, principles and tenets of Polkadot's overall philosophy.
