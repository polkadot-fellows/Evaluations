## Argument

During this retention period, my focus remained on XCM, smart contracts, and expanded into JAM development.

The Asset Hub Migration required careful coordination to prevent disruptions.
It was identified that extrinsics automatically determining reserves would fail for DOT cross-chain transfers so I coordinated patches to address this.
I communicated the alternatives[\[1\]](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/mandatory-action-guide-for-ahm-broken-native-crosschain-transfers/14634) and the importance of automatically determining reserves in clients themselves[\[2\]](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/dapps-action-required-for-ahm-for-keeping-cross-chain-transfers-stable/15169).
Beyond transfers, I implemented code to map a broader range of OpenGov XCM proposals during AHM[\[3\]](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/983).

I configured People Chain to support HOLLAR transfers and allow it for fee payments[\[4\]](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/962), as ongoing support for Project Individuality.

I'm working on making XCM more accessible to smart contract developers through the XTransfers contract[\[5\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANrlaDZtIWPD9Q-CztyHGtTFdTh-I-AT3a_Bm0MZ2z4/edit?tab=t.cp1uz6a5k4b0).
This abstracts XCM complexity for Solidity developers who need cross-chain functionality without deep knowledge in XCM.
The design takes into consideration possible interfaces to improve the developer experience of writing contracts on Polkadot.

I've been expanding into JAM development through work on the JamBrains SDK in C.
This involved implementing all host functions[\[6\]](https://github.com/JamBrains/service-sdk/pull/14), adding parameter decoding[\[7\]](https://github.com/JamBrains/service-sdk/pull/17), and creating a macro to derive the JAM codec[\[8\]](https://github.com/JamBrains/service-sdk/pull/26).
This'll help future JAM service developers to have another language available to use.

On the education side, I lectured at PBA Campus Bali for the Polkadot SDK and JAM modules and participated in a panel with other fellows[\[9\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bzVvoywPfs)[\[10\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX6KyA67nwg).
I presented about XCM in smart contracts at Sub0 in Buenos Aires[\[11\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F9hdLJ_K2c).

Over the next period, I'll move on to working with storage solutions like the Bulletin Chain and expanding my JAM contributions.
