## Evidence

During the reporting period covered by this letter, my main focus was the newest iteration of the XCM format, version 5.
I also helped design Snowbridge V2 and continued my efforts in improving and integrating the new XCM runtime APIs in the ecosystem.

I [participated in a retreat with the snowfork team](https://x.com/_snowbridge/status/1834569673045852412) where we all worked together to design [Snowbridge V2](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/90ff47d989b0498e4e88366b432486e06b1398d8/bridges/snowbridge/docs/v2.md).
It was a good step to understand how the bridge worked and bridges in general.
The final design ended up heavily using some XCMv5 features to provide a simpler and cheaper protocol for users.

[XCMv5 was merged recently](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4826).
Most of my effort this period went into it.
I started it as its own milestone branch from where we created a branch per RFC implementations.
This way we could review each smaller PR individually but make only one merge to master, not needing feature flags for the new version.
I worked on making sure the milestone branch was always up-to-date with master.
I also implemented some of the PRs that went into it, like [not needing to specify weight on Transact](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6228) and [the new fee payment instruction](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5420).
These improvements, along with the whole of XCMv5, will make errors rarer, improving the current situation.

I continued development on the XcmPaymentApi and DryRunApi.
I fixed some bugs like [removing redundant information](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5913) and [clearing messages before dry-running](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5581)
and continued integrating it in runtimes with returning assets in pools with the native asset as fee payment options (PRs [SDK#5599](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5599) and [SDK#6080](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6080)).
Some of these fixes are not yet in the fellowship runtimes since the SDK version is lagging behind.
I [updated asset hub foreign asset ids from XCMv3 to XCMv4](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/472) to prepare for [integrating sdk stable2490](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/490).

These APIs are already live in the runtimes but apps still need time to integrate them.
I [made an app](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-website-to-dry-run-calls-with-any-origin/10786) to allow users and devs to use them and show how they can be used.
I also worked with the PAPI (Polkadot-API) team to develop an XCM SDK that integrates these APIs to estimate fees along the whole journey of an XCM, still under development.
The runtime APIs and new fee payment mechanism will enable apps to correctly estimate XCM fees.

Next period, my focus will be in getting XCMv5 to the hands of developers and users and making it as easy as possible to use it.
