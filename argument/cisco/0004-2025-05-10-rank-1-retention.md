## Argument

During this retention period my focus has mainly remained the same, improving documentation and helping others with XCM.
I've also been learning about solidity and PVM smart contracts to be able to help in the upcoming [Polkadot Hub](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/asset-hub-migration-2025/11129).

I [wrote a document](https://hackmd.io/@n9QBuDYOQXG-nWCBrwx8YQ/BJaLiT4c1x) on what XCM support in Smart Contracts would look like.
It was useful to use this for collaboration on what was needed.
As part of my efforts, I made [a PR for handling ERC20 tokens in XCM](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7762).
I've also been helping with [the XCM precompile](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8471) and [creating a query-response framework for Smart Contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7735) alongside Tiago Bandeira.

I've been collaborating with the [ParaSpell](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) team to improve their [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools) with features from XCMv5, dry-running and fee estimation.
I [wrote a guide](https://hackmd.io/@n9QBuDYOQXG-nWCBrwx8YQ/SJ-rbyFkee) for wallets to dry-run cross-chain transfers to prevent errors and trapping funds.
Out of that, I started [release 1.5.1](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/712) for system parachains to enable the `ExchangeAsset` instruction which can be used to automatically fix problems with ED when transferring to Asset Hub.

On the education front, I attended [PBA Campus wave 6 in Lucerne](https://x.com/AcademyPolkadot/status/1918330507324260621) as an instructor for the Polkadot SDK module.
There, I [created exercises for XCMv5](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/polkadot-sdk-workshop-xcm/) meant to be useful for creating documentation out of it.
I gave another live lecture at the second wave of the PBA-X.

[Documentation for XCMv5](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/pull/477) is on its way.

Over the next period, my plan is to have full XCM support in smart contracts and double down on documentation for XCM.
