## Evidence

I believe that my contributions over the past period demonstrate my commitment to Polkadot's development and are in accordance with a Rank I member of the fellowship.

I've been involved very actively in XCM, adding new features, fixing bugs and improving UX.

Over this period I've felt more and more independent in my work, but at the same time I've collaborated more with ecosystem agents and individuals.
I had the pleasure of attending the fifth wave of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Singapore as a teaching assistant, helping students take their first steps on Polkadot and giving lectures.
For the academy, I [reworked the existing lessons](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-content/pull/1001) of the XCM module and collaborated with other fellows to [build a new XCM workshop](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/polkadot-sdk-workshop-xcm).
I also [gave a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQahedN-nWQ) at Polkadot Decoded in Brussels about the current and future work on XCM.

I continued the integration of the [XcmPaymentApi and DryRunApi](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/380) into the protocol.
This was developed in the last period but after testing [how it improved the UX for dapps](https://github.com/franciscoaguirre/xcm-ui/commit/e18d5706c008a383ec870a959eb49a206fdcba2f#diff-b49726cb42f65129775144bbddf8e0553767728870530307550ac73fed64683a), I integrated it into the fellowship runtimes.
I proposed several RFCs aimed at shaping XCMv5, new features like [a better fee mechanism](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/105) and [a hints mechanism](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/107) but also removing some no-longer relevant aspects like [the fees JIT withdrawal mode](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/106) and [testnet network ids](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/108).

I tackled [an issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/3958) that made a desired use-case impossible to do.
Originally, I made [one big and very specific PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4375).
I saw potential for extracting a [generic aspect of the solution](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5130) that anyone could integrate and then [used it in this particular case](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5131), currently waiting on audit.
I'd like to keep on practicing this approach of dividing big PRs into smaller ones, extracting already useful parts and making them generic to allow other problems to be solved.

In the future, I'm aiming to make more reviews and start extending my area of expertise a bit.
Also, while I did attend various events and shared knowledge there, I'd like to share more in written form on forms and blogs.

Overall, I enjoyed working for the Polkadot ecosystem during this period and felt the relevance of my contributions.
