## Evidence

During this reporting period, I continued my efforts in making XCM easier to use for users, focusing on documentation.
This involved [doing bug fixes](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7423), [setting things up on the production runtimes](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/539) and [helping with docs](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/pull/336).

One of the biggest undertakings right now on Polkadot (aside from JAM) is the [Asset Hub Migration](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/asset-hub-migration-2025/11129).
It's a very important step for better UX and JAM.
I'm very happy I could contribute by [creating a guide](https://hackmd.io/AeQY7IufQU6SsBEjpfLqMw) for changing parachains' DOT reserve from the relay chain to asset hub.

I also took part of an initiative to improve the ecosystem's UX.
I created a [guide on how to use DOT as a fee token on parachains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1IfcfQhlpAKDURzopbv1GUxqC0KGDErHQ9or6DIcEo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.whc2wh4nmhr8) in order to help the ecosystem support DOT as a fee token everywhere, reducing friction for users, both existing and newcomers.

On the education front, I continued helping out with the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.academy/) and gave two live lectures during the first cohort of [PBA-X](https://pbax.polkadot.academy/), their online course focused on the fundamentals.
They were [an introduction to the Polkadot SDK](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jj6scbOJt00bKk--r8wYWJZs6iYnqs6ADbRkf8g-rYg/edit#slide=id.g30c00b30948_0_1334) and [applications of it](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p5YJvJFpa9RlXWNqsmbANjA0gzRdcPuN0StAaetmfHs/edit#slide=id.p).

Next period, I'll keep on working on documentation and guides but switch my focus a little bit to making sure XCM works in the smart contracts that will be deployed on Asset Hub.
