## Evidence

I believe that my contributions over the past period demonstrate my continued commitment to the Polkadot protocolâ€™s development and align closely with the expectations set out in the Polkadot Manifesto for Rank I. Below, I present a series of contributions that substantiate my claim for retention at this rank, focusing on the quality, impact, and relevance of my work.

- **Enhancements to Runtime Macros (CRV2)**
	- **Contribution**: I played a key role in refining the syntax for pallet aliases and improving error handling in the Runtime Macro. While the primary macro was merged earlier, the improvements I made during this period were crucial in enhancing its usability and robustness.
	- **Relevance**: These enhancements are essential for developers working with the Runtime Macro, as they improve its clarity and reliability, which are central to building secure and maintainable code.
	- **Evidence**: [SDK 4769](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4769), [SDK 4643](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4643), [SDK 4249](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4249)
- **Implementation of `TypeWithDefault<T, D: Get<T>>`**
	- **Contribution**: I introduced this feature that allows for custom default types, that can then be used to return the current block number as a default nonce. This addition directly addresses a critical security issue related to the replay of immortal transactions.
	- **Relevance**: By mitigating security risks, this implementation contributes to the robustness of the Polkadot network, ensuring safer transaction handling.
	- **Evidence**: [SDK 4034](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4034)
- **Support for Unsigned Transactions to Trigger Tasks**
	- **Contribution**: I added the support for submitting valid tasks via unsigned transactions, that could be triggered by an offchain worker. 
	- **Relevance**: This feature extends the usability of tasks, making them suitable for long-running cleanup activities that are not critical to be performed on each block.
	- **Evidence**: [SDK 4075](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4075)
- **Documentation and Rust Analyzer (RA) Support Improvements**
	- **Contribution**: I resolved issues with macro documentation links and added RA support, significantly enhancing the developer experience by making the SDK more accessible and easier to use.
	- **Relevance**: Improving documentation and tooling is critical for onboarding new developers and ensuring that existing ones can work efficiently.
	- **Evidence**:[SDK 5023](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5023)
- **FRAME Crate Publishing and Improvements**
	- **Contribution**: I contributed to the publication and improvement of the FRAME crate, reducing the need for importing numerous crates just to make a pallet work.
	- **Relevance**: This work simplifies the development process, making it easier for developers to build on Polkadot and reducing barriers to entry.
	- **Evidence**: [SDK 4370](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4370), [SDK 4406](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4406)
- **Sanitization of Default Configurations**
	- **Contribution**:: I proposed and implemented changes to remove production configs, as discussed in the community forum, and suggested a better approach for default configurations in pallet templates.
	- **Relevance**: This work enhances the security and maintainability of the codebase, ensuring that defaults are safe for production use.
	- **Evidence**: [SDK 4965](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4965), [FORUM 7584](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/seeking-feedback-on-derive-impl-for-default-configurations-in-pallet-templates/7584/1)
