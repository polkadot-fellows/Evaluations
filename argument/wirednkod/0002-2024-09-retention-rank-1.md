## Evidence

Over the past several months, my primary focus has been the development and continuous improvement of the Fellowship Dashboard website ([List of PRs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/dashboard/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Awirednkod+created%3A%3E2024-05-01)). This has involved a number of significant updates and redesigns aimed at enhancing the user experience and ensuring the platform is fully optimized for both stability and accessibility - and transfering it to a dedicated URL: **https://polkadot-fellows.xyz** .

A key element of this work was upgrading the website to support the stable Polkadot API (v1.x), including integration with light clients for improved performance. I undertook a complete redesign of the website, prioritizing user-friendliness and mobile responsiveness. In addition, I restructured the menu to allow users to easily navigate content based on category, further improving accessibility.

I collaborated closely with the Fellowship Secretary to ensure all website content is up-to-date([1](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/dashboard/pull/487), [2](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/dashboard/pull/490), [3](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/dashboard/pull/491)), including the most current information related to the Fellowship.

Also added all the records for [monthly calls and meeting minutes](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/dashboard/pull/336), and I developed a streamlined process for contributors to submit updated meeting minutes and YouTube links.

Beyond these tasks, I have been working on solutions for Fellowship members to connect their accounts to the dashboard. This includes implementing support tools within the scope of a Polkadot dedicated library called [Polkadot-UI](https://polkadot-ui.xyz), which is heavily using Polkadot API under the hood, to enable members to check functionalities related to their accounts (such as salary details, promotion/demotion schedules, referenda voting, etc.). I have also created forms to simplify the submission of evidence for rank retention and promotion.

In addition to my work on the Fellowship Dashboard, I contributed to the Polkadot JS apps by introducing an interface for the Head Ambassadorâ€™s Collective, with the relevant updates available at this [link](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/10838).
