## Argument

The reporting period gave me a chance to push my [PolkaVM for parachain runtimes](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704) project to its near-final stage. I rebased it onto [RFC-145](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/145) [implementation branch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8866), which allowed me to resolve the remaining memory-management issues. Also, I switched to 64-bit PolkaVM, which helps overcome many 32-bit architecture limitations and will definitely give a performance boost. The PR is entering the maintenance stage; I'll support it until the RFC-145 implementation is merged, and then I'll proceed with its adoption.

In other respects, I was improving and caring for my lovely zoo of RFCs, and I addressed issues found by other fellows. That includes:
* [RFC-145](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/145) (which introduces a runtime-side memory allocator) and its reference implementation in ([#8641](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8641) and [#8866](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8866));
* [RFC-156](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/156) (which proposes adding BLS12-381 host functions) and its reference implementation, which I created in the reporting period in [#10327](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10327)
* Pre-existing [RFC-123 implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6029) I'm pushing forward.

Recently, I became involved in the Proof of Personhood work; nothing to brag about yet, but I'll keep you posted.

To summarize, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and therefore, I'm applying for retention at Rank II.
