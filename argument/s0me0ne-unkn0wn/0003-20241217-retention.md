## Evidence

I was busy researching the state size growth problem and doing a lot of tests and participating in discussions regarding the switch to 10 Mb PoVs:
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5334
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5884
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5887

I also actively participated in the Spammening event, and created the Yet Another Parachain runtime, which was used as a target during the parachain spammening:
https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6089

Besides that, I started performing a deep dive into PolkaVM integration and put some effort into keeping the toolchain up to date (https://github.com/paritytech/rustc-rv32e-toolchain/pull/33), although in the end, it wasn't needed as the changes we required were propagated upstream in the meantime. I created a working PoC of PolkaVM-enabled parachains (https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6704) and helped a bit to push the latest PolkaVM into Substrate: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6533 .

To sum up, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and thus, I'm applying for retention at Rank I.
