## Evidence

I participated in the Coretime revenue integration into the production relay chains (polkadot-fellows/runtimes#384), a valuable contribution that brought us closer to the finalization of the Coretime enablement roadmap and made the chain [RFC-5](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0005-coretime-interface.md) complaint (to the extent that makes sense in the scope of the current protocol implementation). To prove the correctness of changes, I also co-authored a respective smoke test (paritytech/polkadot-sdk#4883), which became the very first CI test utilizing Zombienet v2 API.

Besides that, I performed refactoring to move blocking operations performed by the candidate validation subsystem to the external workers (paritytech/polkadot-sdk#5142). It's an optimization that allows smoother subsystem operation in case of high backpressure.

I also kept cleaning up the `im-online` removal mess (polkadot-fellows/runtimes#267), which is essential for maintaining the purity of the codebase.

My recent work included sophisticated research on how the state size affects throughput; its results have yet to be published. However, as a side effect of the study, I found, investigated, and reported a severe bug in block weight calculation (paritytech/polkadot-sdk#5229).

To sum up, my work during the reporting period was valuable, and thus, I'm applying for retention at Rank I.
