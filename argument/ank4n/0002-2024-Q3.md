## Evidence
Continuing from my previous [evidence](https://github.com/Ank4n/Evidences/blob/805002ec11b8b349c0381d950467219a93af132f/evidence/ank4n/0001-ank4n-2024-H1.md), my primary focus has been to [enable nomination pool members to participate in OpenGov](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000188140). While this is already live on westend, it was pending audits before it can be enabled in production. Since then, I have addressed various improvements and fixes raised during the audit process. These changes are included in the [polkadot-sdk/stable2409](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/tag/polkadot-stable2409) release and once [Polkadot's runtime is upgraded to this version](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/455), over [24M DOTs](https://apps.turboflakes.io/?chain=polkadot#/pools) owned by members of the pool will be eligible to participate in voting.

PR list: [#4822](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4822), [#4804](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4904), [#4981](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4981), [#4998](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4998), [#4999](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4999).

However, these changes have the unintended consequence that a [direct staker will not be able to participate in the pool anymore](https://hackmd.io/@ak0n/delegate-stake-faq#Dual-staking). The root cause is that `pallet-staking` uses [locks](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/currency/trait.LockableCurrency.html) (similar to [freeze](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/freeze/index.html) in the deprecated [Currency](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/currency/index.html) trait) instead of [holds](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/hold/index.html). This is largely due to legacy code, and `pallet-staking` should ideally use `holds`. I also have a [working PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5501) to address this issue, which is currently awaiting review and audit.
