## Argument

During this reporting period, I have been focusing on 2 main directions:

- I continued the work related to limiting and optimizing the heap memory usage in Polkadot. Here, a lot of the basic 
building blocks were already in place and during the previous reporting period I had opened a 
[new PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9480) for implementing the main objective of the milestone 
which is lazily decoding the extrinsics in a block. During this reporting period I followed through with this PR, 
polished it, addressed all the code review comments and finally merged it. The remaining work here is related to 
keeping track of the nested double-encoded structures as well: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8675 . 
I started working on this and I plan to open a PR soon.

- I started ramping up on the parachains core logic and I started contributing to the collators protocol 
revamp project. My most significant contributions here so far are related to the 
[main PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8541) that introduces the new collation manager 
and subsystem implementations. The PR had been opened by Alin a long time ago mostly as a draft, and I'm working on 
polishing it and getting it a state where it can be merged.
