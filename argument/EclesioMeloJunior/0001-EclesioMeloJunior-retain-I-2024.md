## Evidence

Hello everyone, My name is Eclesio and I have been a Gossamer Core Developer from almost 3 years. Since last year my challenge is to make Gossamer a stable node and make it sync to the Westend network tip. Along this path I was able to understand a lot of the Polkadot internals, how pallets works and are composed.

I've also written a long-form post explaining how Polkadot epochs works from the host point of view (there is a small explanation on how it works on the runtime side): https://blog.chainsafe.io/babe-epoch-changes/
