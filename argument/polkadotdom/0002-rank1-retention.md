## Argument

As another retention period passes, I draw attention to my work over the past couple of months on:

### 'Hard Pressure' Issuance Model

With the passing of [Ref 1710 - Hard Pressure Capped & Stepped Supply Schedule](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1710), I worked with the community to quickly get an implementation together in [#898](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/898). This new model addresses concerns of high inflation by introducing a capped total supply and a stepped, deflationary issuance schedule, creating a more predictable macroeconomic environment for DOT. The new code represents a significant departure from the previous and required the implementation of new stepped curve types. And while the inflation changes only required an asymptotic stepped curve, I felt it was a good opportunity to bolster our curves primitives module, adding linear and percentage based curves as well. My hope is these new curves will be a benefit to the entire ecosystem. The general purpose curves can be found [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9556).

### RFC 150 - Voting While Delegating

I have continued to refine [RFC-150](https://github.com/PolkadotDom/RFCs/blob/dom/voting-while-delegating/text/0150-voting-while-delegating.md) at the request of fellow members. This RFC addresses the issue where token holders who delegate their voting power cannot vote directly on individual referenda they feel strongly about. It proposes a mechanism to allow these delegators to override their delegate's vote on a case-by-case basis, increasing direct participation in governance. I believe the changes led to a refinement in my thinking around what makes a good RFC and I hope to carry that into the future.

### Community & Indirect work

During this period, I contributed to the (currently ongoing) discussion around the asset hub USD stablecoin. I engaged with community members regarding the topic as well. Continuing in that line, I was active in telegram providing assurance and insights for the upcoming 'hard pressure' model to a group of community advocates. I, of course, also kept up to date on all the happenings within and around Polkadot, from SDK and runtime changes to WFC Refs and other governance initiatives. I attended all OpenDev calls to give updates on my work.
