## Evidence
Recent contributions to the "pallet-revive" project, which focuses on executing PolkaVM smart contracts:

- [pallet-revive] Updated `delegate_call` to accept an address and weight. This update enhances the flexibility of the delegate_call function by allowing it to accept both an address and a weight parameter. This change is crucial for optimizing contract interactions and ensuring better resource management. [PR #6111](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6111)

- [pallet-revive] Aligned `ext_code_hash` with the EIP-1052 specification. This implementation brings our `ext_code_hash` function in line with the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1052 (EIP-1052), which standardizes how contract code hashes are retrieved. This alignment improves compatibility and interoperability with existing Ethereum smart contracts. [PR #6088](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6088)

Recent work on the "revive" project, Yul and Solidity compiler targeting RISC-V (PolkaVM):

- [revive] Fix implementation of storage/transient read and write [PR #100](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/pull/100)

- [revive] Chore: improve runtime api return value names [PR #81](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/pull/81)

- [revive] Developed the translation of `delegate_call` translation from YUL IR to LLVM IR [PR #80](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/pull/80)

- [revive] Corrected the implementation of `balance_of` [PR #79](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/pull/79)

- [revive] Developed the translation of `extcodehash` translation from YUL IR to LLVM IR [PR #77](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/pull/77)
