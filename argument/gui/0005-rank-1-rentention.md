## Argument
This period, I made contributions to the SDK by fixing some potential DOS vectors of the transaction pool on some experimental feature. ([The fix task feature](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10162)).
Reviewed various PRs on the SDK, one about the still ongoing item of migration from currency to fungible trait. ([PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10195)),
a new macro asked by the community: stored [PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10195),
PRs to deprecate validate unsigned: [PR1](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10150), [PR2](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10716).
This work is necessary to keep polkadot SDK up to date and in a good state.

I also reviewed other PRs and continued the work for declaring multiple version of transaction extension pipeline in one runtime ([PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7035).

Aside from this my main work is on proof-of-personhood, where I continue developing still private components for this system.
