## Argument

During the reporting period, I switched focus from scalability, stability, and performance of the Polkadot network to helping with the launch of the smart contracts platform on assethub by working on the foundry `Embedded EVM` project, whose goal was to integrate pallet-revive as an execution backend into foundry `forge test`.

My contributions here were mostly around modifying pallet-revive and adding new APIs to allow foundry to better control and access the state of pallet-revive. Initially, my main focus was on providing functionality for various cheatcodes like prank, mocks, etch, and store, and then testing, debugging, and providing fixes so that the top three most important smart contracts platform tests can be successfully run. Full list of [PRs](https://github.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aalexggh+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged) and [issues](https://github.com/paritytech/foundry-polkadot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20assignee%3Aalexggh).

Additionally, I supported the Qadrivium and Chainsafe teams in delivering their proposals (see [Qadrivium](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1689?tab=timeline) and [Chainsafe](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1699#1)). My role was advisory, providing technical reviews and guidance in my areas of expertise, for example, [approval voting rewards](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9687) and the new [erasure-coding algorithm](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10116).

Over the last two months I have begun working on improving the polkadot-sdk statement-store protocol. This initiative is ongoing, my focus is twofold: profiling the node to improve performance so it can support larger scale with lower propagation latency, and redefining the API surface and implementing it (see [Proposed API](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10452)).

### Other work:

Besides the mentioned topics, I'm providing reviews for my area of expertise in polkadot-sdk and RFCs.
