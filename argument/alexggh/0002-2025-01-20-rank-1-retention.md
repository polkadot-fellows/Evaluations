## Evidence
During the reporting period I continued my work on improving the scalability and stability of the Polkadot network.

On the scalability side, progressed on the goal of expanding the number of validators and cores to 1000 validators and 200 cores [Issue 5867](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5867)
, by enabling and monitoring approval-voting-parallel on kusama [PR6218](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6218), increasing
the number of validators on kusama from [500 to 600](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/484), helping with debugging [litep2p enablement issues](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7076#issuecomment-2589613046) 

On the stability side, I've been doing the following things:
- Extend our tooling, by implementing a bitfields performance command to find validators with bad performance [PR834](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-introspector/pull/834).
- I've been actively involved in debugging live issues on the main polkadot network E.g: [Kusama parachains spammening aftermath](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2025-11-25-kusama-parachains-spammening-aftermath/11108/3) & [
Parachain Blocktimes Increasing
](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6910#issuecomment-2555655711)
- Implemented series of bug fixes, discovered during the above investigations and while running other doomsday scenarios: [PR6690](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6690), [PR6696](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6696), [PR6729](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6729), [PR6807](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6807), [PR6864](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6864), [PR6971](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6971), [PR6973](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6973) and [PR6913](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6913)
- Provided [Polkadot reviews](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Aalexggh+sort%3Aupdated-desc) in the areas and domains I'm familiar with.
