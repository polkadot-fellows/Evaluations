## Argument

In the last 3 months, my work has spanned technical contributions, application support on Snowbridge, as well as an expanded focus on Polkadot initiatives outside of Snowbridge.

### Snowbridge V2

Snowbridge V2, which brings major cost savings to bridge users, was released on-chain around middle October. I worked on off-chain support for Snowbridge V2, including the Snowbridge TypeScript SDK, and supporting Snowbridge V2 in the Snowbridge app. Snowbridge V2 will be enabled for Ethereum <> AssetHub routes in the next week, realizing cost savings for users. I also added developer documentation for Snowbridge V2, and wrote the Snowbridge V2 release announcement on the Polkadot Forum.

### Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade

I was responsible for Ethereum Fusuka support on Snowbridge. This covered on-chain version support, off-chain relayer support and the Polkadot BridgeHub runtime upgrade referendums.

### Polkadot Social Account Recovery

To in effort to expand my contributions in the ecosystem outside of Snowbridge, I have collaborated with Oliver Tale-Yazdi to work on social account recovery on Polkadot. I have created a basic UI to demonstrate the functionality (backend to be completed).

### Incident Response and Recovery

#### Runtime Upgrade Problems

For the first time in Snowbridge's history on Polkadot mainnet, we had our first incident.
A member of our team noticed failing transactions on BridgeHub and alerted our team. I immediately realized what happened (that BridgeHub was not upgraded, while AssetHub was). I uploaded the BridgeHub runtime wasm 5 minutes after we discovered the outage, minimizing affected transactions. While the incident was regetable, I believe it demonstrated my commitment and knowledge to maintain a high availability service.

#### Polkadot AssetHub migration

The Snowbridge and bridges team were both under the impression that Snowbridge would not
be affected by the AssetHub migration. A day before the migration, I realized that this
might not be the case. After further investigation from our team, we saw that Snowbridge 
would be affected by the migration, enabling us to make the necessary provisions to ensure
no user transactions are affected. This again shows a proactive response from my side to 
ensure a working service.

### Conclusion

I believe my contributions this last month are worthy of Rank II to retention, and hope 
you will favourably view my application.
