## Argument

We are exploring the introduction of a decentralized stablecoin for Polkadot, with the long-term objective of reducing structural sell pressure on DOT and improving capital efficiency within the ecosystem.

As part of this initiative, I have been researching established stablecoin architectures. The goal is not to replicate any existing system directly, but to evaluate how their design principles can be adapted to Polkadot’s constraints.

As part of this effort, I am in the process of taking over the [vaults](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10699) and [auctions](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10994) pallets. I conducted a detailed review of their current implementation and proposed a number of structural and design changes to the authors. In parallel, I am working on an alternative implementation approach, with the intention of simulating multiple models and comparing their behavior under different economic scenarios.

In addition to research work, I have been mentoring @dhirajs0 and @cirko33.

With @dhirajs0, I have been working on governance-related topics. Together, we finalized and merged Multi-Asset Bounties for the upcoming Kusama and Polkadot releases ([runtimes/1070](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/1070)). We have also proposed several improvements to existing governance mechanisms ([polkadot-sdk/11100](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/11100), [polkadot-sdk/11199](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/11199), [polkadot-sdk/11099](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/11099)).

I onboarded @cirko33 to the meta-transactions topic. We addressed several security issues in the current implementation and are now preparing practical guidelines for the community on how to configure meta-transactions in a runtime and how dApps can integrate with them.
