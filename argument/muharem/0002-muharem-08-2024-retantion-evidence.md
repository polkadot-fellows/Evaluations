## Evidence

It’s been a little over three months since I submitted my last retention letter ([letter1](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/Evaluations/pull/6)), and with this letter, I want to share what I’ve been working on during this time, particularly in relation to the Polkadot Fellowship Program.

In recent month, I’ve been addressing an issue reported by users who were unable to access their funds on accounts created using the pure proxy feature. The users mistakenly assumed ownership of the same account on different parachains and subsequently received funds on those accounts ([polkadot-sdk/3288](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/3288)). I’ve documented the problem and proposed a solution in a recently published RFC ([RFC: Pure Proxy Replication](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/111)).

I’ve also started work on the next iteration of changes to the Treasury and Bounty pallets. A project document outlining the objectives and implementation details has been published ([polkadot-sdk/5500](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5500)). These changes include some of the most requested features and serve as the first step in moving Treasury functionality from the Relay Chain to the Asset Hub. Additionally, I’ve published an API specification for the spend call, which has been a source of considerable debate ([polkadot-sdk/4715](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4715)). This new specification will enable scenarios where a spend is commanded on one chain, with assets being withdrawn on another and deposited on yet another chain.

Several issues concerning Asset Hub arose that required quick resolution. One issue involved transaction payments using exchangeable assets, where the paying account needed to maintain an existential deposit of a native asset, causing problems in certain cases. This issue was promptly addressed and resolved ([polkadot-sdk/448](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4488)). Additionally, transaction payments that depended on the previous fungibles implementation were causing issues ([runtimes/328](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/328)), so they were migrated to the new implementation ([runtimes/332](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/332)). Finally, the identifiers of trust-backed assets were transitioned to an auto-increment model to prevent the possibility of ID reuse. ([polkadot-sdk/4757](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4757), [runtimes/346](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/346), [runtimes/414](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/414)).

I also took over the asset rewards pallet and brought it to a state ready for review ([polkadot-sdk/3926](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3926)), moving it forward to enable the setup of incentives for drawing liquidity to the pools on Asset Hub.
