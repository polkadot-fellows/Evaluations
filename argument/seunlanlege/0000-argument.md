## Argument

I am working on Hyperbridge, a trustless interoperability protocol that will be natively connected to the upcoming Polkadot Hub. This work directly contributes to the Polkadot ecosystem by enabling secure cross-chain communication and expanding the network's interoperability capabilities.

### **Hyperbridge's Contribution to Polkadot**

Hyperbridge's integration with Polkadot Hub will enable secure cross-chain communication with various external blockchains, enhancing the interoperability capabilities of the Polkadot network. This integration will facilitate the transfer of assets, and data across different blockchains, growing its overall addressable user and developer base. Over the past year we've expanded the 
number of networks Hyperbridge supports, including Unichain, Polygon, and more. With more networks planned this year. 

My contributions meet the requirements for Rank II retention through active development and evangelism efforts. My team and I have been making technical contributions to the Polkadot SDK to enable the integration of Hyperbridge with Polkadot Hub. This includes:

 - [paritytech/polkadot-sdk#10140](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10140) - Introducing support for inherent transactions to pallet-revive

Beyond code contributions, I have been actively advocating for important protocol improvements such as the implementation of BLS-BEEFY, which would enhance the cryptographic infrastructure of the Polkadot network and benefit projects like Hyperbridge that rely on efficient bridge verification mechanisms.

### Evangelism
- Been actively pushing for the implementation of BLS-BEEFY, which would improve the cryptographic efficiency and security of the BEEFY consensus gadget used for light client bridges
- Engaging with the Polkadot technical community on interoperability and bridge-related discussions
- Given talks about Polkadot's technology at various conferences and meetups.
