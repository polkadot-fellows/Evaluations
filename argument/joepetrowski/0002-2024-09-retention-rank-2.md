## Evidence

In the time since my [last evaluation
submission](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/Evaluations/pull/8/files), I have been less focused
on technical implementation work and more on roadmap and management work at Parity.

The project I have been most involved in is the integration of Solidity-compatible smart contracts
on Asset Hub and the migration of Polkadot's primary sub-systems (Staking, Governance, and Balances)
from the Relay Chain to Asset Hub.

At this stage, my work has primarily been the project's specification and developing concrete plans
for delivery of the project and ensuring that it will go smoothly with all of the stakeholders
(parachains, apps and UIs, exchanges, tooling, etc.).

Besides working on the future of Asset Hub, I have also contributed to:

- Review of Fellowship PRs and release coordination (including the release of Polkadot's Coretime
  chain).
- Launch of the Polkadot People chain and migration of identities there.
- Further diversification of the multi-asset Treasury.

I also stay active in the community, attending events like Decoded and participating on the forum,
governance platforms, and group chats.

## Voting record

|  Ranks | Activity thresholds | Agreement thresholds | Member's voting activities | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|I  |90%   |N/A   |   |  |
|II |80%   |N/A   | I have voted on 2 out of 2 referenda in which I was eligible to vote (i.e 100% voting activity). Out of 2 referenda in which members of higher ranks were in complete agreement, I have voted in line with the consensus 2 times (i.e 100% voting agreement). |  |
|III|70%   |100%  |   |  |
|IV |60%   |90%   |   |  |
|V  |50%   |80%   |   |  |
|VI |40%   |70%   |   |  |

## Misc

- [ ] Question(s): 

- [ ] Concern(s): 

- [ ] Comment(s): My last evaluation was for "promotion to rank III". However, since the referendum
  did not pass within the demotion period, I was demoted to rank I and then promoted back to II.
  Since I am still within the promotion period at that rank, this evaluation is for retention at
  rank II.
