## Argument

Like my last report, I have spent the last six months continuing to work on the Asset Hub Migration
(AHM) and the introduction of a smart contract stack to Polkadot via Revive.

For AHM, the migrations happened successfully on both Kusama and Polkadot. Besides the protocol
success of the migrations, they were also a UX success. With a few minor exceptions, all major
wallets, UIs, exchanges, etc. supported the migration. Balance transfers, staking, governance, etc.
are now all happening primarily via Asset Hub. This event in practice wraps up the Minimal Relay
initiative described in
[RFC-32](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/072e255/text/0032-minimal-relay.md).

Since the last reporting period, we made the decision to add an EVM implementation as a deployment
option in Revive. That means it will be able to target two VMs, PVM and EVM. Testing and auditing
are currently nearing completion and we expect a December release from Fellowship with the system
live on Polkadot in January 2026.

As these two projects near completion, I am turning my focus toward Personhood and supporting
infrastructure to build applications on Polkadot, which was the primary rationale for these efforts.
