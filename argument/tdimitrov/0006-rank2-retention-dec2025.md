## Argument

During the reporting period I've wrapped up the collator protocol stop-gap testing and switched my
focus to the collator protocol revamp testing. I've finished the initial version of the malus-collator
implementation (which is not yet public so I can't reference it here) and ran some negative testing
with zombienet locally.
Currently I am improving the logging and traceability of the collator-protocol revamp and I am doing
tests on Versi with more nodes.

During this period I've also found and fixed an issue with the collator protocol stop gap solution.
More details can be found in [polkadot-sdk pr-10163](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/10163).
