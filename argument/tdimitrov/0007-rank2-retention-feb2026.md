## Argument

During this reporting period, my primary focus was driving the collator protocol revamp to
completion. I finalized @alindima’s work on the collation manager and the main subsystem.
Additionally, I developed a comprehensive test plan for the new implementation and a deployment
strategy for rolling out the changes on Westend.

I also verified the protocol’s resilience against spam attacks and confirmed that the collator scoring
system functions correctly. Both were validated using malus-collator and local zombienet-sdk tests.
Finally, I applied minor fixes to malus-collator and extended it with a new malicious behavior.
